        "abstract": "The growing demand for upgraded electronic products has resulted in a significant amount of waste batteries. In this paper, we propose a low-carbon, scalable mechanochemical waste-to-value strategy to convert spent ZnO from alkaline batteries into Zn-MOF-74, a functional metal\u2013organic framework (MOF), for CO2 capture. The conversion pathway of ZnO-to-MOF-74 was investigated via structural characterization techniques. Compared with commercial ZnO with a hexagonal prism-like morphology, spent ZnO, exhibiting a rod-shaped morphology, demonstrated greater readiness in transforming into Zn-MOF-74, completing the transformation in nearly 5 h via ball milling and reducing energy consumption by around 50%. Moreover, the CO2 adsorption capacity of Zn-MOF-74 synthesized using spent ZnO, which is 2.07 mmol/g (at 273 K), is nearly triple that synthesized from commercial ZnO that has a hexagonal prism-shaped morphology. Overall, this study highlights the potential of repurposing spent ZnO in waste valorization, thereby significantly contributing to the advancement of a circular economy. \u00a9 2024",

        "abstract": "The extensive use of mineral fertilizers has a negative impact on the environment, whereas wastewater and microalgal biomass can provide crops with nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and have the potential to be used as a source of fertilizers in circular agriculture. In this study, a step-by-step resource utilization study of algae-containing wastewater generated from microalgae treatment of swine wastewater was carried out. When wheat seedlings were cultivated in the effluent after microalgae separation, the root fresh weight, seedling fresh weight, and total seedling length were increased by 3.44%, 14.45%, and 13.64%, respectively, compared with that of the algae-containing wastewater, and there was no significant difference in seedling fresh weight, total seedling length, maximum quantum yields of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), and performance index (PIABS) from that of the Hogland solution group, which has the potential to be an alternative liquid fertilizer. Under salt stress, microalgae extract increased the contents of GA3, IAA, ABA, and SA in wheat seedlings, antioxidant enzymes maintained high activity, and the PIABS value increased. Low-dose microalgae extract (1 mL/L) increased the root fresh weight, seedling fresh weight, longest seedling length, and total seedling length by 30.73%, 31.28%, 16.43%, and 28.85%, respectively. Algae extract can act as a plant biostimulant to regulate phytohormone levels to attenuate the damage of salt stress and promote growth. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.",

However, the extraordinarily low purification efficiency still limits the practical application of this strategy. Herein, the lamellar NiOOH is in-situ anchored on the industrial waste red mud surface (ARM/NiOOH) as an adsorbent to purify organic dyes in wastewater. ARM/NiOOH adsorbent with high specific surface area and porosity provides considerable active sites for the congo red (CR), thereby significantly enhancing the removal efficiency of CR. Besides, we fit a reasonable adsorption model for ARM/NiOOH adsorbent and investigate its adsorption kinetics. Resultantly, ARM/NiOOH adsorbent can remarkably adsorb 348.0 mg g\u22121 CR within 5 min, which is 7.91 times that of raw RM.

        "abstract": "This study focused on quantifying and valorizing domestic waste in Bukavu, a rapidly growing city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). With increasing anthropogenic pressure, waste management has become a pressing issue, yet documentation in this area is still limited. This study aimed to fill this gap by providing comprehensive data on domestic waste generation, composition, and disposal practices in Bukavu city. Through field surveys and analysis, waste quantities and types were documented, revealing significant challenges in waste management infrastructure and practices. Additionally, the study explores opportunities for waste valorization, particularly through composting, given the region's agricultural potential and growing urban food demand. The findings revealed that ~ 5% of the domestic waste is biodegradable, with the majority consisting of metals and plastics. These wastes are predominantly used as livestock feed (10%), incinerated (66%), or buried (17%), with ~ 5% undergoing composting. Waste management is primarily handled by children (82%), with very few non-governmental organizations (NGOs) involved in such activities. Among the three composting methods evaluated, outputs from vermicomposting demonstrated superior qualities in terms of promoting crop growth, increasing yield, and achieving a high germination index. Overall, the application of composts improved plant growth and yield parameters of the two major legumes (common bean and soybean). Future interventions should explore the implementation of large-scale composting units at the household or citywide level, while also considering additional strategies to enhance the quality of the compost products. Such efforts are crucial in mitigating the environmental and health impacts of urban household waste and promoting sustainable practices in urban agriculture. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, biofuel production has attracted considerable attention, especially given the increasing worldwide demand for energy and emissions of greenhouse gases that threaten this planet. In this case, one possible solution is to convert biomass into green and sustainable biofuel, which can enhance the bioeconomy and contribute to sustainable economic development goals. Due to being in large quantities and containing high organic content, various biomass sources such as food waste, textile waste, microalgal waste, agricultural waste and sewage sludge have gained significant attention for biofuel production. Also, biofuel production technologies, including thermochemical processing, anaerobic digestion, fermentation and bioelectrochemical systems, have been extensively reported, which can achieve waste valorization through producing biofuels and re-utilizing wastes. Nevertheless, the commercial feasibility of biofuel production is still being determined, and it is unclear whether biofuel can compete equally with other existing fuels in the market. The concept of a circular economy in biofuel production can promote the environmentally friendly and sustainable valorization of biomass waste. This review comprehensively discusses the state-of-the-art production of biofuel from various biomass sources and the bioeconomy perspectives associated with it. Biofuel production is evaluated within the framework of the bioeconomy. Further perspectives on possible integration approaches to maximizing waste utilization for biofuel production are discussed, and what this could mean for the circular economy. More research related to pretreatment and machine learning of biofuel production should be conducted to optimize the biofuel production process, increase the biofuel yield and make the biofuel prices competitive. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s)",

A set of reviews were conducted on biochar production by pyrolysis process from various waste biomass which has drawn extensive interest due to the low cost of production with several benefits. As many potential technologies have been developed, there are still several knowledge gaps that have been identified for some key points to contribute a comprehensive study towards soil fertility, nutrient and water retention, soil microbial activity, plant growth and yield, pollution remediation, mitigation of greenhouse gas emission and an improvement in the farmer\u2019s economy to achieve maximum profit by adopting environmentally friendly technique \u201cpyrolysis\u201d. Therefore, this review explored a detailed study on food waste biochar production by the pyrolysis process and its impact on different applications as an amendment. Slow pyrolysis process at low and medium temperatures is a potential amendment for agriculture production and soil and water remediation by enhancing biochar properties like carbon, BET surface area, cation exchange capacity, zeta potential, and nutrient content, etc. with minimum ash content. The biochar enhances soil water and nutrient retention capacity, crop yield, and improved microbial community at different soil quality. Additionally, food waste to biochar is a realistic adsorbent and economical carbon sequester to mitigate GHG emissions. This review conducted a brief assessment of the knowledge gaps and future research directions for researchers, encouraging investigators, stakeholders, and policymakers to make the best possible decision for food waste valorization. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.",

        "abstract": "In a context where sustainable construction and ecology are increasingly central, the construction industry is constantly seeking alternative materials that are both economical and eco-friendly. Concurrently, global rice production generates significant amounts of rice husks, often considered as low-value waste. This study deviates from traditional approaches that favor the use of rice husk ash (RHA) as a mineral additive, to explore the potential of rice husks themselves as a complete substitute for sand in concrete formulations. After meticulous characterization of the physicochemical properties of rice husks, several concrete formulations were designed and subjected to a battery of tests. The results are promising. They show that concrete based on rice husks exhibits satisfactory mechanical properties for a wide range of applications, from slabs to load-bearing walls. The compressive strength varies between 0.56\u00a0MPa and 5.41\u00a0MPa depending on the composition, while the thermal conductivity falls within a range of 0.070\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22121\u00a0K\u22121 to 0.129\u00a0W\u00a0m\u22121\u00a0K\u22121, which is comparable to other agro-concretes.

Additionally, pectins extracted from coffee pulp with acid, Coffea arabica pectin (CAP), hot water-soluble pectic fraction (HWSP), and chelating agent-soluble pectic fraction (CSP), were used to develop pectin-chitosan films. Flow and viscoelastic properties of film forming solutions were assessed, showing better characteristics for the pectins from the pulp over those from the residual water. The different composition of the pectin fractions allowed to relate film properties with their structural features and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed interactions between pectin and chitosan in the films. Results showed that CAP-Chit and CSP-Chit films were transparent, hydrophobic, and had the best mechanical properties.

        "abstract": "The usage of plastics has increased reliably over the years. Worldwide plastic pollution has grown to 460 million tons annually, increasing global greenhouse gas emissions by 3.4 %. In recent years, several studies have been performed utilizing microorganisms for bioremediation. The aggregation of microplastics affects marine aquatic life, posing a severe threat to the aquatic environment and hurting the global food chain. Bioremediation of various polymers is cost-effective and environmentally feasible compared to chemical, physical, and biophysical methods. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are photosynthetic organisms and can generate value-added products from waste, i.e., waste valorization and minimization. The present study uses Cyanobacterial sp. (Anabaena & Nostoc) to degrade the synthetic polymers prepared in lab-scale conditions. Weight loss of the degraded polymers was examined, and polymeric characteristics were analyzed through SEM, FTIR, XRD, and AFM. The experimental study observed that the polymers degraded by about 70 % and 82 % by Nostoc and Anabaena sp. in about eight weeks (approx. Two months). Polymers are degraded into monomers such as vinyl alcohol, ethylene, terephthalic acid, polycaprolactone from polyethylene terephthalate, and polyvinyl alcohol. They further break down into carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and water. These are identified from the LCMS-MS analysis. The experimental data for the degradation of polymers in Cyanobacteria sp. and control media fitted the Sinclair and Peppas kinetic model well. The results inferred that those cyanobacteria could degrade the polymers very effectively since it is a potent bioremediatory agent that can remove different organic and inorganic contaminants from the environment. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.",

The curing temperature of the synthesized bio-benzoxazine monomer was found to be 216\u00b0C. Utilizing the carbon obtained from two different bio-sources namely, chicken feather and cashew nut shell cake bio-polybenzoxazine composites were prepared. The char yield of bio-carbon reinforced bio-polybenzoxazine composites was enhanced to 65% compared to that of neat polybenzoxazine (60%). The value of the dielectric constant of neat polybenzoxazine was found to be 5.52 which was further improved to a maximum of 8.9 and 7.8 on reinforcement of 15 wt% chicken feather carbon and 15 wt% cashew nut shell cake carbon respectively. The prepared bio-polybenzoxazine composites exhibit a near superhydrophobic nature with the value of water repulsive angle at 150\u00b0 than that of neat matrix (143\u00b0). From the obtained results, it is suggested that the sustainable bio-carbon reinforced bio-based benzoxazine will be a promising material for thermally stable, high dielectric, and water-repellent applications. Highlights: Eco-friendly, sustainable magnolol-based bio-benzoxazine was synthesized. Waste valorization for bio-carbon\u2014poultry, and agricultural wastes were utilized.

Co-pyrolysis of biomass and refuse derived fuel (RDF) offers a promising pathway for valuable products that combine various benefits including enhanced energy recovery, waste valorisation, improved product quality, and environmental sustainability. Consideration of specific feedstocks and optimization of process parameters are necessary to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the co-pyrolysis process. This work presents investigations of the co-pyrolysis process of lignocellulosic biomass wastes (rye straw and agriculture grass) and RDF. These biomasses ensure efficient decomposition. The RDF, high in carbon (78.5 %) and hydrogen (11.8 %), was predominantly plastic based. Based on Py-GC-MS studies at 600 \u00b0C, it was observed that the addition of RDF to biomass caused a significant decrease in the share of organic oxygen compounds among the released decomposition products. Laboratory tests were performed in a fixed-bed reactor for raw biomass and RDF and 1:1 and 3:1 biomass to RDF mass ratio. The results demonstrated that the yield of char production decreased with the addition of RDF, which promoted the bio-oil yield. Despite, RDF pyrolysis meets problems, it was proved that co-pyrolysis of biomass and RDF is a good solution for their utilization. \u00a9 2024 The Authors",

Their chemical composition comprises neral, geranial, 1,8-cineole, terpinen-4-ol, and oplopanonyl acetate, compounds with recognised antimicrobial activity. Concerning antimicrobial activity, significant differences were found using different hydrosol concentrations (10\u201320% v/v) in comparison to a control (without hydrosol), showing the potential of the tested hydrosols to inhibit the microbial growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans.

        "abstract": "The current study introduces an innovative methodology by utilizing treated wastewater (TWW) from an effluent treatment plant as a washing agent to enhance the characteristics of incineration bottom ash (IBA). This approach addresses sustainability concerns and promotes the circular economy by reusing wastewater generated in municipal solid waste incineration facilities. Previous research has underscored the challenges of open IBA reuse due to elevated leaching of chlorides, sulfates, and trace metal(loid)s. Thus, the experimental setup explores various combinations of washing, with or without screening, to optimize the properties of soil-like material (SLM < 4.75 mm) and overall material (OM < 31.5 mm) fractions of IBA for unrestricted applications. Batch leaching tests were conducted on treated samples, and leaching characteristics were evaluated in accordance with regulatory standards, primarily the Dutch standard for unrestricted IBA reuse. The findings reveal that washing in isolation proves insufficient to enhance IBA properties; however, washing followed by screening, specifically for removing fines (<0.15 mm), proves effective in reducing contamination. The study identifies that multiple steps of washing and screening (with recirculation) process render OM and SLM fractions suitable for unrestricted reuse with a cumulative liquid-to-solid ratio of 6 L/kg and a total washing time of 15 min. The multi-step treatment was found effective in reducing sulfate contamination by 65\u201374 % and chloride contamination by 83\u201389 % in IBA fractions. This approach offers a promising solution for overcoming the limitations associated with IBA leaching, thereby promoting sustainable waste reuse practices. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

This review explores how these issues can be effectively mitigated while shedding light on the transformative impact of food waste valorization on health management. A spotlight is cast on vitamin A deficiency (VAD), an acute public health concern, especially prevalent in South Asia, driven by economic constraints, sociocultural factors, inadequate diets, and poor nutrient absorption. VAD's devastating effects are exacerbated by limited education, lack of sanitation, ineffective food regulations, and fragile monitoring systems, disproportionately affecting children and women of childbearing age. Recent studies in South Asian countries have revealed rising rates of illness and death, notably among children and women of childbearing age, due to VAD. To address inadequate dietary intake in children utilizing vegetable waste, particularly from carrots and beetroot, which are rich in \u03b2-carotene, and betalains, respectively, offers a sustainable solution. Extracting these compounds from vegetable waste for supplementation, fortification, and dietary diversification could significantly improve public health, addressing both food waste and health disparities economically. This approach presents a compelling avenue for exploration and implementation. In summary, this review presents an integrated approach to tackle health and food waste challenges in the developing world.

In this paper, IISWs from different sources are introduced firstly, including coal (coal fly ash, coal gangue, flue gas desulfurization gypsum), metallurgy (steel slag, blast furnace slag, electrolytic manganese residue, red mud, etc.), chemistry (phosphogypsum, lithium slag), construction (waste glass, ceramic waste), mining (tailings) and other industries. Then the main research progress of IISWs in building material preparation (cement, aggregate, glass, ceramic, road, brick), water/air treatment (catalyst and adsorbent), and soil improvement (fertilizer and remediation agent) is discussed in detail. At the same time, the role of IISWs in material systems and the solidification/stabilization (S/S) mechanisms of heavy metals in IISW-based materials are emphasized. Finally, the challenges of IISWs material utilization are discussed, and prospects for the development of this field are proposed. Overall, the construction industry is expected to achieve large-scale and comprehensive utilization of IISWs, while the research in other fields requires more value-oriented and industrialized exploration. More importantly, the migration and transformation of heavy metals in IISWs during material utilization need full attention. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "Conventional management mechanisms for construction waste recycling and reuse (CWRR) often cause considerable information asymmetry, inadequate government supervision, and imperfect incentive mechanisms, resulting in frequent illegal dumping and landfilling of construction waste and relatively low recycling rates. To address these issues, we introduce blockchain technology to CWRR. The design science research methodology was adopted to identify the main steps in functional requirement identification and blockchain framework development for CWRR. To explain how blockchain can improve the CWRR process, a conceptual model for the functional requirements of the proposed framework was constructed using qualitative analysis. A blockchain-driven framework was developed to overcome practical barriers in the CWRR industry. Based on scenario simulation results, the proposed framework had execution and transaction costs of $4.735 and $1.276, respectively, and latency performance at the millisecond level. The results indicate that (1) based on specific problems systematically identified from CWRR practices, the proposed framework can address practical barriers in the CWRR industry more directly; (2) the CWRR industry can use blockchain technology to achieve information sharing, comprehensive government supervision, and effective incentive mechanisms and (3) the blockchain-driven framework has high efficacy and can promote efficient CWRR and high-quality development of CWRR industry chain. This management model is conducive to forming a collaborative CWRR industry chain that can lead to broader adoption of blockchain technology across industries. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "This study introduces the sustainable recovery of energy from plantation waste by converting rubber tree residue (RTR) into syngas through carbon dioxide (CO2)-assisted pyrolysis. The investigation centers on elucidating the specific impact of CO2 on the pyrolysis of rubber tree residue, emphasizing its significant influence on enhancing syngas production. At temperatures \u2265 500 \u00b0C, CO2 engages with volatile matters (VMs) released during the thermolysis of rubber tree residue, increasing carbon monoxide (CO) yields. To further optimize the process, catalytic pyrolysis setups incorporating additional heat (600 \u00b0C) and a nickel-based catalyst (Ni/Al2O3) were implemented. These experimental configurations substantially increased syngas production from 19.51 to 24.24 mmol g\u22121, particularly amplifying CO yields under CO2 conditions 2.58-fold compared to nitrogen (N2) conditions. This enhancement is attributed to the partial oxidation of volatile matters facilitated by CO2. Additionally, the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst played a pivotal role in expediting the gas-phase homogeneous reaction of CO2 with volatile matters, leading to further improved syngas production. Indeed, the syngas yield in the catalytic pyrolysis in the presence of CO2 was 24.24 mmol g\u22121, which increased by 1.24 times in reference to the result under the N2 environment. The identified functional role of CO2 presents an opportunity to enhance the sustainability of waste management by optimizing carbon utilization and generating value-added products. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "Although biomass is carbon-neutral, its use as a primary feedstock faces challenges arising from inconsistent supply chains. Therefore, it becomes crucial to explore alternatives with reliable availability. This study proposes a strategic approach for the thermochemical valorization of food processing waste, which is abundantly generated at single sites within large-scale processing plants. As a model biomass waste from the food industry, orange peel waste was particularly chosen considering its substantial consumption. To impart sustainability to the pyrolysis system, CO2, a key greenhouse gas, was introduced. As such, this study highlights elucidating the functionality of CO2 as a reactive feedstock. Specifically, CO2 has the potential to react with volatile pyrolysates evolved from orange peel waste, leading to CO formation at \u2265490 \u00b0C. The formation of chemical constituents, encompassing acids, ketones, furans, phenols, and aromatics, simultaneously decreased by 15.1 area% in the presence of CO2. To activate the efficacy of CO2 at the broader temperature spectrum, supplementary measures, such as an additional heating element (700 \u00b0C) and a nickel-based catalyst (Ni/Al2O3), were implemented. These configurations promote thermal cracking of the volatiles and their reaction kinetics with CO2, representing an opportunity for enhanced carbon utilization in the form of CO. Finally, the integrated process of CO2-assisted catalytic pyrolysis and water-gas shift reaction was proposed. A potential revenue when maximizing the productivity of H2 was estimated as 2.62 billion USD, equivalent to 1.11 times higher than the results from the inert (N2) environment. Therefore, utilizing CO2 in the pyrolysis system creates a promising approach for enhancing the sustainability of the thermochemical valorization platform while maximizing carbon utilization in the form of CO. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Carbon black (CB) is the most widely used reinforcing filler for rubber. Nowadays there are several concerns regarding this traditional petroleum-based filler: on one side its environmental footprint is enormous and its production process is no more sustainable and on the other side its price increases annually. For these reasons, sustainable alternative fillers are being studied. In the present research the main waste of the steel industry, namely the steel slag from electric arc furnace (EAF), is investigated as non-conventional filler for a nitrile butadiene rubber matrix (NBR). The slag has been characterized to ensure its safe reuse as filler according to the heavy metals leaching. The slag filled compounds have been characterized and compared to CB filled compounds, in terms of processability by rheometric parameters, mechanical properties, Payne effect, and physicochemical properties to investigate the filler-matrix interaction. From the obtained results, it was shown that EAF slag-filled NBRs are comparable to CB filled NBRs in terms of crosslink kinetics and, when compared at the same hardness level, are comparable in terms of viscosity, stiffness, and elongation at break, while when compared at the same filler volume fraction are similar in terms of compression set and stress relaxation. \u00a9 2023",

To promote sustainability through a circular economy approach, this work tries to demonstrate the environmental gains that are obtained by bringing together, in an industrial symbiosis action, two large industrial sectors (the pulp and paper and the road pavement sectors) responsible for generating large amounts of wastes. A sustainability assessment, based on a life cycle and circular economy approach, is presented here, and discussed using a simple case study carried out on a real scale. Two wastes (dregs and grits) from the pulp and paper industry (PPI) were used to partially replace natural fine aggregates in the production of bituminous mixtures used on the top surface of road pavements. The impacts at a technical, environmental, economic, and social level were assessed and it was shown that this simple waste valorization action is not only positive for the final product from a technical point of view, but also for the environment, causing positive impacts on the different sustainability dimensions that were evaluated. \u00a9 2024 by the authors.",

This work demonstrates the successful simultaneous removal of Al(III), B(III), Ba(II), Cr(III), Mg(II), Sr(II), Pb(II), and Zn(II), from electroplating wastewater by ladle slag. First, Cr(III) and Pb(II) removals were evaluated in single synthetic systems by analyzing the influence of pH, temperature, and ladle slag dosage. Competitive removal was observed in binary batch experiments of Cr(III) \u2013 Pb(II), achieving 88% and 96% removal, respectively, with fast kinetics following a pseudo-second-order model. The findings of XRD, SEM, EDX, and FTIR of the slag after removal helped to elucidate the synergic removal mechanism involving ladle slag dissolution, precipitation, ion exchange, and adsorption in a tight relationship with the solution pH. Lastly, ladle slag was tested in real electroplating wastewater with the aforementioned ions at concentrations ranging from <1 to 1700 mg/L. The removal was performed in two steps, the first attained the following efficiencies: 73% for Al(III), 88% for B(III), 98% for Ba(II), 80% for Cr(III), 82% for Mg(II), 99% for Pb(II), 88% for Sr(II), and 88% for Zn(II). Visual MINTEQ simulation was utilized to identify the different species of ions present during the removal process. Furthermore, the leaching tests indicated a minimal environmental risk of secondary pollution in its application.

        "abstract": "Carbonation curing can improve material properties and reduce the concrete industry's carbon emissions. This study used powder prepared from waste coral to replace ordinary Portland cement (0, 10, and 20 %). After initial curing for 24 h, the mortar was cured by sealing and carbonation. The dilution effect of coral powder substantially reduces the mechanical properties under sealing curing. Under carbonation curing, the coral powder helps develop carbonation and CO2 diffusion, reducing strength loss and increasing resistivity. XRD and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis results showed that carbonation transforms hydration products and clinker phases into different types of CaCO3, such as calcite and aragonite. The novelty of this study is that it proposes a method that organically combines carbonation curing and marine waste reuse. Provide a sustainable solution to the problem of material shortage in marine engineering construction. Moreover, the carbon footprint can be considerably reduced by replacing cement materials, improving carbonation curing efficiency, and promoting CO2 uptake. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "Designing a new material for precious metals (PMs) recovery is of ultimate significance in the quest to explore highly efficient, selective, and stable adsorbents for a sustainable economy and green environment. Herein, novel amine-rich cyclotriphosphazene poly(tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)methane-co-cylotriphosphazene)- porous nano-cages (PTC-PNC) and microspheres (PTC-MS) were synthesized for adsorption and selective recovery of Au(III) and Pd(II) in aqueous solution. A combination of the abundant amine groups and the cage-like porous morphology of PTC-PNC makes it an ideal absorbent for recovery of the Au(III) (1592 mg g\u22121, pH 1.0, 60 oC) and Pd(II) (1372 mg g\u22121, pH 1.0, 60 oC) with high selectivity which was slightly decreased up to 8-11% even in the presence of 13 co-existing metals ions while an ultra-high recovery of 99% was obtained. The unique cage-like morphology of the PTC-PNC guarantees a fast adsorption equilibrium while the adsorption isotherm specifies a pseudo-second-order kinetic behavior and Langmuir isotherm. Amine groups were the most energetically favorable sites for the capturing and chelating of Au(III) and Pd(II) ions followed by their partial reduction to Au0 and Pd0. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and high-resolution transmission electron spectroscopy (HRTEM) analysis were employed to explore interactions and reduction mechanisms during the adsorption process. Adopting the waste-to-resource approach, after Au(III) and Pd(II) recovery, these adsorbents were applied for catalytic hydrogen generation from ammonia borane (AB) hydrolysis. Due to its favorable electronic structure, the PTC-PNC@Pd exhibited a higher hydrogen generation than PTC-PNC@Au. The as-synthesized PTC-PNC could be employed as a promising material for other MPs' selective recovery and green energy generation applications. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.",

The review consolidates research evidencing the ability of LM to diminish CO2 emissions, conserve resources, and reduce environmental damage while maintaining material quality. Notably, alkali-activated LM has emerged as a noteworthy innovation, showing enhanced mechanical strengths due to pozzolanic reactions with reactive silica sources.

The resulting extract demonstrated robust antioxidant activity, reflected in the elevated total phenolic content (TPC) and free radical scavenging ability. Furthermore, the effect of the extract on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and TPC-1 cancer cells was assessed. PBMCs exposed to the extract at 10 mg/mL concentration exhibited enhanced viability, whereas cancer cells displayed concentration-dependent cytotoxic responses, indicating a selective anticancer effect. These findings underscore the potential of winery pomace extract as a natural antioxidant with promising anticancer properties, warranting further investigation for potential applications in cancer therapy. Moreover, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents one of the first publications to demonstrate the potential of wine pomace extract to inhibit thyroid cancer cells. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

The goal of this work was to study the complete genome of K. nataicola and gain insight into the functional genes in K. nataicola that are responsible for BC synthesis in acidic environments. Methods and result: The pure culture of K. nataicola was obtained from yeast-glucose-calcium carbonate (YGC) agar, followed by genomic DNA extraction, and subjected to whole genome sequencing on a Nanopore flongle flow cell. The genome of K. nataicola consists of a 3,767,936\u00a0bp chromosome with six contigs and 4,557 protein coding sequences. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree and average nucleotide identity analysis confirmed that the bacterial isolate was K. nataicola. The gene annotation via RAST server discovered the presence of cellulose synthase, along with three genes associated with lactate utilization and eight genes involved in lactate fermentation that could potentially contribute to the increase in acid concentration during BC synthesis. Conclusion: A more comprehensive genome study of K. nataicola may shed light into biological pathway in BC productivity as well as benefit the analysis of metabolites generated and understanding of biological and chemical interactions in BC production later. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",

        "abstract": "This study compares the climate change impacts of three methanol production processes: the conventional method via steam methane reforming, and two alternatives \u2013 gasiforming and electriforming \u2013 which utilize plastic waste as feedstock. A gate-to-gate LCA approach is employed, considering credits and substitution impacts for avoiding traditional end-of-life treatment of plastic waste. Influential local parameters for GWP reduction are identified to include electricity carbon footprint, waste treatment infrastructure, incinerator efficiency, and the utilization of captured CO2 streams. Regional conditions are found to be crucial, as demonstrated by a case study comparing technology choices among EU27+3 countries. The study concludes that the novel plastic waste treatment and methanol production processes, have the potential to mitigate climate change impact, particularly when diverting plastic waste from incineration. With carbon-neutral electricity and avoided incineration, the specific impact reduction in methanol production can reach 2 kg CO2e per kg methanol. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s)",

Stalks and bolls of BRS cotton cultivars from Sementes do Brasil (Green, Ruby, Topaz and Jade) were studied, using white cotton (BRS 286) as a comparison. The energetic potential of biomass was evaluated by bulk density, High Heating Value (HHV), proximate and ultimate analysis, compositional and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Pyrolysis was performed in a micro-pyrolyzer and the products were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (Py-GC/MS). The results indicated a significant energetic potential, suggesting that can be used as an alternative energy source for thermochemical processes. The results of conventional pyrolysis indicated the presence of oxygenated compounds of different organic groups: aldehydes, ketones, phenols, furans and ethers, characteristic of the decomposition of lignocellulosic materials. Light organic acids in the C1-C4 range stood out the most, followed by phenols that appeared in a considerable proportion. Finally, it is concluded that the energy potential and pyrolysis products of the different parts (stalks and bolls) of colored cotton waste can be used to generate bioenergy and various chemical compounds of plant origin from green chemistry. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.",

        "abstract": "Background: The textile industry has several negative impacts, mainly because it is based on a linear business model that depletes natural resources and produces excessive amounts of waste. Globally, about 75% of textile waste is disposed of in landfills and only 25% is reused or recycled, while less than 1% is recycled back into new garments. In this study, we explored the valorisation of cotton fabric waste from an apparel textile manufacturing company as valuable biomass to produce lactic acid, a versatile chemical building block. Results: Post-industrial cotton patches were pre-treated with the aim of developing a methodology applicable to the industrial site involved. First, a mechanical shredding machine reduced the fabric into individual fibres of maximum 35\u00a0mm in length. Afterwards, an alkaline treatment was performed, using NaOH at different concentrations, including a 16% (w/v) NaOH enriched waste stream from the mercerisation of cotton fabrics. The combination of chemo-mechanical pre-treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis led to the maximum recovery yield of 90.46 \u00b1 3.46%, corresponding to 74.96 \u00b1 2.76\u00a0g/L of glucose released, which represents a novel valorisation of two different side products (NaOH enriched wastewater and cotton textile waste) of the textile industry. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK m850, engineered for redirecting the natural alcoholic fermentation towards a homolactic fermentation, was then used to valorise the glucose-enriched hydrolysate into lactic acid. Overall, the process produced 53.04\u00a0g/L \u00b1 0.34 of l-lactic acid, with a yield of 82.7%, being the first example of second-generation biomass valorised with this yeast strain, to the best of our knowledge. Remarkably, the fermentation performances were comparable with the ones obtained in the control medium. Conclusion: This study validates the exploitation of cotton post\u2013industrial waste as a possible feedstock for the production of commodity chemicals in microbial cell-based biorefineries. The presented strategy demonstrates the possibility of implementing a circular bioeconomy approach in manufacturing textile industries.

In prior research, predominant focus has been on examining various adsorbents for removing PPCPs from single-pollutant systems. However, no study has delved into simultaneous adsorption of PPCPs multi-pollutant mixture. This study evaluates performance of Azadirachta indica leaf extract-based green-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles coated on spent tea waste activated carbon (ZTAC) for removing sulfadiazine (SZN) and acetaminophen (ACN). Adsorption investigations were conducted in single-component (ACN/SZN) and binary-component (ACN + SZN) systems. The synthesized ZTAC was characterized using SEM, XRD, FTIR, EDX, porosimetry and pHpzc analysis. The study examines impact of time (1\u201360 min), dose (0.2\u20134 g/L), pH (2\u201312) and PPCPs concentration (1\u2013100 mg/L) on ACN and SZN removal. Various kinetic and isotherm models were employed to elucidate mechanisms involved in sorption of PPCPs. Furthermore, synergistic and antagonistic aspects of sorption process in multi-component system were investigated. ZTAC, characterized by its crystalline nature and surface area of 980.85 m2/g, exhibited maximum adsorption capacity of 47.39 mg/g for ACN and 34.01 mg/g for SZN under optimal conditions of 15 min, 3 g/L and pH 7. Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic model best-fitted the experimental data indicating chemisorption mechanism. Removal of ACN and SZN on ZTAC demonstrated synergistic nature, signifying cooperative adsorption. Overall, valorization of ZTAC offers effective and efficient adsorbent for elimination of PPCPs from wastewater. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.",

The impact of refractance window drying at varying temperatures on the physical, chemical, and technological properties of protein isolates was comparatively evaluated in comparison to spray drying. Dry matter content, water activity, protein content, color, particle size, bulk density, tapped density, flow properties, solubility, water and oil holding capacity, surface hydrophobicity, emulsification, and foaming properties of protein isolates were analyzed. Results showed that the drying method and temperature significantly influenced the properties of the protein isolates. Spray drying produced protein isolates with better color, higher solubility, surface hydrophobicity, and foaming properties than refractance window drying. However, refractance window drying resulted in better flow and emulsification properties of protein isolates. The temperature of refractance window drying was found to be effective on protein content, color, particle size, bulk and tapped densities and emulsification properties of protein isolates.

        "abstract": "Sodium hydroxide necessitates the implementation of cleaner production methods that deviate from the conventional practices in the chlor-alkali industry. New sustainable sources such as concentrated brines, which are typically regarded as waste, are currently being investigated for the production of sodium hydroxide using Electrodialysis with Bipolar Membranes (EDBM). This process has the advantages of not producing gas by-products, reducing operational risks, and providing value to waste brines after converting them into acids or alkali solutions. However, the production of sodium hydroxide via EDBM using brines is limited by the low concentration of the final base (e.g. typically below 2 M), which increases the cost of transport. This study aims to overcome this limitation by optimizing parameters such as salt-to-base volume ratio, initial salt concentration, and current density values. Notably, this research is one of the few to employ Response Surface Methodology with a Central Composite Design to maximize the final sodium hydroxide concentration; two models using second-order polynomial equations were proposed. Results showed the possibility to achieve 5.3 M NaOH under a volume ratio range of 9.8:1\u201310:1, a current density range of 490 A/m\u22122 to 500 A/m\u22122, and an initial salt concentration in the range of 6 M NaCl. Moreover, the energetic analysis showed values of specific energy consumption in a range of 2.5 kWh kgNaOH-1-3.5 kWh kgNaOH-1 and specific productivity of the process up to 3.08 tonNaOH year\u22121 m\u22122, which are moderate in comparison with values previously presented in literature. Finally, an economic analysis showed that energy was the most significant cost component, making up 89 % of the total process cost, which was estimated to be 0.69 \u20ac kgNaOH-1 (concentration 21.2 % w/w). Overall, these high concentration values open a real chance to shift towards sustainable production of NaOH by means of EDBM from brines, highlighting the novelty of this study. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.",

Here, the layered double hydroxides (LDHs) grown on wood-derived aerogels (WAs) were prepared after screening the powdered precursors and named La/MgFe-LDH(LS)@WAs. The intricate pore structure and surface morphology of the WAs formed a fibrous network with ultra-low density, good strength and elasticity, allowing for uniform loading. The sample exhibited excellent adsorption capacity of 139.5 mg P/g at pH 4.0, and over 100.0 mg P/g within a wide pH range (3.0\u20138.0). Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models could effectively describe the dynamic adsorption process. Microscopic morphology and textural characteristics of the samples were characterized and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were used to study the interaction mechanisms. The coordination bonds and weak interactions between the active component LS and La(OH)3 with phosphates were characterized using interaction region indicator (IRI) and independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld molecular density partitioning (IGMH) methods. The atomic \u03b4g index mapped to the molecular structure vividly illustrated the maximum contribution of hydroxyl hydrogen to phosphate deprotonation oxygen in inter-fragment interactions on LS. Combining the formation of Me-O-P bonds characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the mechanism involves weak interactions (hydrogen bond) and chemical adsorption via ligand exchange. High removal efficiency was demonstrated in real wastewater. A method for waste reuse was also proposed. Plant cultivation experiments showed that La/MgFe-LDH(LS)@WAs could sustain wheat growth with slowly degrade and maintain high phosphate availability. The composite shows potential for water restoration, waste treatment, and value-added conversion in the production of controlled-release fertilizers. \u00a9 2024",

        "abstract": "Cement production is responsible for large anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, partly through the decarbonization of limestone rock. Reducing the clinker/cement ratio is a viable alternative to reducing the environmental impact of construction. To achieve this, the continued exploration of additional cementitious materials is necessary. With adequate particle size and chemical composition, construction and demolition waste powder (CDWP) can be used as supplementary cementitious material (SCM). In this sense, the present work aims to evaluate the CDWP physical-chemical characteristics when subjected to thermomechanical treatment (calcination and milling), aiming for application as SCM. The powders (fraction smaller than 150 \u00b5m) were subjected to different calcination temperatures (600, 700, 800, and 900\u00b0C) without milling and milled for 5 hours. The physicochemical characterization was carried out using laser granulometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry (TG), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), BET, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), specific mass, pozzolanic activity index (PAI) and Portlandite consumption. The results indicate that thermomechanical activation made it possible to obtain a powder with physical-chemical characteristics of interest for application as SCM. The amount of Si2O, Fe2O3, and Al2O3 is greater than 70 %, making them suitable. Calcination from 700\u00b0C presents a loss of ignition of less than 6 %, meeting regulatory requirements for pozzolanic materials. Milled for 5 hours leads to a 75 % reduction in particle mean diameter. With the combination of thermal and mechanical treatments, a PAI of 97 % was obtained, and a decrease in the quantity of Portlandite of 12 %. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated a significant influence of thermal and mechanical treatment on the compressive strength of mortars. Based on the data found, it can be stated that CDWP has the potential to be used as an SCM, decreasing CO2 emissions from the cement industry and contributing to the circular economy of the construction sector. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "In this work, we studied the effect of physicochemical properties of synthesized biochar/iron oxide composites on tetracycline (TC) removal from an aqueous system. The TC removal involved adsorption and degradation using Fenton-like and Photo-Fenton-like reactions. The results showed that the adsorption capacity of synthesized materials inversely varied with the pyrolysis temperature, achieving removal percentages of 72 %, 65 %, and 56 % for materials developed at pyrolysis temperatures of 400 \u00b0C, 500 \u00b0C, and 600 \u00b0C, respectively. Regarding the Fenton-like and Photo-Fenton-like processes, BC-500-m exhibited the best catalytic performance attributed to its structural conformation and phase composition of iron oxide. This enabled the removal of 84 % of tetracycline. BC-500-m also showed a low reaction rate, resulting in a 53 % removal of TC through the Photo-Fenton process. However, a high degradation capacity and potentially mineralizable by-products into CO2 and H2O suggest that photo assistance establishes a cleaner and more ecosystem-friendly reaction mechanism. The reuse capacity decreased from 84 % to 12.5 % after five cycles, indicating a reduced availability of active sites to remove TC due to the possible generation of complexes between Fe+2 and the TC. It is a significant advancement that through the thermochemical valorization of lignocellulosic resources such as brewer's spent grains (BSG), it is possible to establish sustainable and ecosystem-friendly bifunctional removal mechanisms capable of mediating the remediation of water with the presence of pharmaceuticals through a circular economy. \u00a9 2024 The Authors",

Innovative technologies are being leveraged to convert waste tires into valuable products and energy, promoting resource recycling and mitigating environmental harm. While existing literature has highlighted key technologies in the waste tire valorization process, this study aims to comprehensively review the current advancements in waste tire valorization from various angles, including processes, optimization, and evaluation, to support its sustainable development. Firstly, it outlines advanced technologies in the waste tire valorization process for producing value-added products, such as grinding, pyrolysis, and critical devulcanization stages. Secondly, it summarizes simulation and optimization techniques applied in waste tire valorization. Lastly, it discusses the application of sustainable assessment methods like techno-economic assessment, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in waste tire valorization, proposing the establishment of a unified assessment system. The review findings suggest that (1) developing a super-structural waste tire valorization framework offers a promising path for technological enhancement and low-carbon sustainable transformation. (2) Integrating mechanism and data-driven method in simulation modeling enhances result accuracy and interpretability. (3) Creating a multi-objective optimization model to optimize waste tire valorization from economic, technological, social, and environmental perspectives can drive efficient and low-carbon development.

        "abstract": "Recent disasters involving upstream raised tailings dams in Brazil have caused regulatory agencies to prohibit the construction of new upstream dams and demand the decommissioning of existing ones. As such, new alternatives are being sought to safely dispose of iron ore exploitation byproducts. The dry stacking of filtered tailings is an option to diminish the risks associated with tailings storage facilities and cope with new legislation. Accordingly, this paper studies new solutions for enhancing the performance of tailings for dry stacking purposes. The behavior of reinforced and nonreinforced iron ore tailings-alkaline-activated cement (AAC) blends was studied through unconfined compressive strength tests and conventional triaxial testing. The AAC is produced from the residues of iron ore exploitation (waste and tailings). The addition of fibers has enhanced the performance of cemented iron ore tailings with increased strength regardless of the fiber content and ductility. Also, reinforcement effectiveness values were greater than those reported for other cement agents, due to the lower stiffness of the cemented matrix from AAC compared with others. A comparative analysis between using only AAC and ACC plus 0.5% of fibers within the \u03b7=Biv framework was proposed. The dosage curves for the same qu value yielded an AAC \u00bc 20.80% for AAC only and AAC \u00bc 3.80% when using 0.5% of fibers. Therefore, using fibers can collaborate with the feasibility of using a new waste-based AAC to construct dry stacking facilities. \u00a9 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

        "abstract": "Aluminium smelter waste (ASW) is a big contributor to landfills, and its recycling has been of great interest. This study investigates the tribological properties of aluminium matrix syntactic foams manufactured using an Al 6082 alloy and ASW. Ball-on-disc tests were conducted under both dry and lubricated conditions. Under dry sliding conditions, the coefficient of friction (COF) had an initial sharp increase, followed by a gradual decrease and finally a steady state as the sliding distance increased. The wear surfaces showed the presence of adhesive, abrasive and oxidative wear, with some presence of delamination. Syntactic foams containing small ASW particles led to a decrease in surface roughness, decrease in the average COF and decrease in specific wear. Heating large ASW particles before manufacturing the syntactic foams enhanced overall wear properties because the particles are hardened due to a compositional change. The T6 treatment of the syntactic foams enhanced the wear properties due to the hardening of the Al matrix. The average COF of the ASW syntactic foams was higher than that of the E-sphere syntactic foam, which was predominantly abrasive wear. The specific wear of the ASW syntactic foams can be higher or lower than the E-sphere syntactic foam, depending on the ASW particle size. Under lubricated sliding test conditions, the wear was reduced significantly, and the type changed from predominantly adhesive to predominantly abrasive. The porous ASW particles acted as lubricant reservoirs and provided a constant supply of lubricant, further improving the lubrication effect. \u00a9 2024 by the authors.",

The operating temperature inside the gasifier varies according to the feature of the biomass cuts (from 174 \u00b0C for the peduncles to 557 \u00b0C for palms). The experimental setup is also equipped with a cyclone, allowing for the recovery of some of the tar produced during the tests.

The presence of polyphenols in biofloc extracts has been reported, and these molecules have been widely explored for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in green nanotechnology. Polyphenols are employed to reduce silver ions and stabilize AgNPs. Compared to conventional methods (chemical synthesis), green synthesis makes the production of AgNPs sustainable and environmentally friendly by offering lower costs and avoiding the generation of hazardous waste that could impact the environment. This study proposes the extraction of polyphenols from bioflocs and their use as reducing and capping agents in the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles as a way to add value to the waste generated in BFT. Response Surface Methodology was used to obtain better extraction conditions by investigating the influence of four reaction variables (temperature, time, ethanol concentration, and solvent/solute ratios). The obtained extract was used to synthesize silver nanoparticles (BFAgNPs), which were used to determine the minimum inhibitory activity (MIC) and bactericidal activity (MBC) against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as their anti-biofilm activity (inhibition and destruction) against A. baumannii. The highest polyphenol content was 1,918 \u03bcg gallic acid equivalents/g and the antioxidant activity was 1,278 \u03bcM Trolox equivalents/g for DPPH and 12,513 \u03bcM Trolox equivalents/g for ABTS. BFAgNPs exhibited an average diameter of 25.3 nm, as observed by transmission electron microscopy. Dynamic light scattering indicated a particle diameter of 123.2 nm, and polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.15. The zeta potential was measured at \u221222.5 mV. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed distinct bands at 3616, 2924, 1682, 1532, 1234, and 1042 cm-1. BFAgNPs demonstrated MIC (38.8 \u03bcg/mL and 19.4 \u03bcg/mL for A. baumannii and P.aeruginosa), and MBC (77.5 \u03bcg/mL and 38.8 \u03bcg/mL for A. baumannii and P.aeruginosa) and antibiofilm activity, (47.3% inhibition and 27.8% destruction, respectively). It was concluded that the biofloc residue constitutes a source of polyphenols useful for the synthesis of AgNP with antibacterial capacity, thus representing a potential alternative for the waste valorization of BFT effluent. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.",

        "abstract": "Despite the potential economic benefit that can be realized, universities in developing countries continue to invest money in disposing of solid wastes. This is because they often view solid wastes as a burden and a problem, rather than as a potential resource. This paper presents the results of a study that examined the sources, composition, and volume of solid waste at the University of Dodoma, the largest campus in Tanzania, and explored its potential environmental and economic benefits. The study found that the university generates an annual average of 644.56 tonnes of solid waste, with paper and cardboard accounting for 35.81%, plastics for 43.73%, e-waste for 2.38%, food waste for 9.24%, clothes for 5.72%, glass for 1%, and metals for 2.12%. In spite of the potential economic benefits of recycling and composting, the university currently disposes of most of its waste, and does not engage in sorting and separation of waste at the source. The study estimates that 90.76% of the recyclable waste generated at the university has an economic value of 142,301.20 USD annually, and could be sold to relevant recycling markets, while 9.24% of the waste is compostable and has the potential to be used for biogas generation and composting. The paper discusses the economic potential of each identified solid waste stream, and presents recommendations for profitability and sustainable environmental management on campus. The paper offers valuable insights for other universities with similar settings and aspirations for sustainable waste management practices. \u00a9 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

Effective fractionation of the cellulose from paper sludge presents an opportunity to yield cellulose as feedstock for value-added processes. A novel approach to cellulose fractionation is the sidehill screening system, herein studied at the pilot-plant scale. Composition analysis determined ash removal and carbohydrate retention of both sidehill and high-performance benchtop screening systems. Sidehill screening resulted in greater carbohydrates retention relative to benchtop screening (90% vs 66%) and similar ash removal (95% vs 98%). Techno-economic analysis for production of sugar syrup yielded a minimum selling price of $331/metric ton of sugar syrup including disposal savings, significantly less than a commercial sugar syrup without fractionation. Sensitivity analysis showed that screening conditions played a significant role in economic feasibility for cellulosic yield and downstream processes. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

Pyrolysis treatment could reduce its volume while producing fuel or products valuable for the chemical industry. Pressurized pyrolysis at 400, 450, and 500 \u00b0C is carried out in a lab-scale autoclave at initial pressures 4.2, 8.4, and 16.8 bar. Product gas yield increases slightly along with elevated pressure as well as temperature. However, beyond 8.4 bar the initial pressure makes no discernible differences. CO and CO2 are the major gas species followed by CH4. CO contributes the most to the product gas energy content followed by C3 species, C2H6, and H2. Calculated energy content (heating value) is between 2 and 15 MJ\u00b7Nm\u22123. In terms of product gas energy content, low pressure pyrolysis is favorable over high pressure pyrolysis. According to integration areas of chromatographic measurements the liquid phase contains up to 25 % of N-compounds, with benzonitrile being the most abundant, followed by toluene, o-xylene, and ethylbenzene. The solid char maintains constant properties across operating conditions, with carbon and energy contents of approximately 75 wt% and 30 MJ\u00b7kg\u22121, respectively. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s)",

Emissions from the waste management sector rank as the seventh-largest contributor to global emissions. Efforts are underway to decarbonize steel processes and promote waste reuse. \u201cFluff\u201d, generated during ferrous scrap processing, poses reuse challenges due to its characteristics. This study evaluates the production of wood\u2013plastic composites using polypropylene and \u201cFluff\u201d to address environmental concerns and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Methodologically, waste characterization preceded the extrusion of waste and polypropylene blends at varying compositions. The resulting materials were pelletized, molded, and characterized. CO2 emission reductions from waste diversion from landfills were assessed under two scenarios. In Scenario 1, emissions totaled 19,054 tons/year, while in Scenario 2, with gas capture and utilization, emissions reached 10,617 tons/year for 20,000 tons of waste annually. Composite characterization revealed favorable properties, suggesting viability for wood\u2013plastic production.

        "abstract": "The production of mineral fertilisers relies heavily on mineral deposits that are becoming depleted or is based on processes that are highly energy demanding. In this context, and in line with the circular economy and the European Green Deal, the recovery of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) from organic wastes using chemical technologies is an important strategy to produce secondary raw materials for incorporation into mineral fertilisers, partially replacing the traditional sources of N, P, and K. However, there are very few studies on the agronomic and environmental effects of such substitution. The aim of this work was to evaluate plant growth under microcosm conditions and the effect on the soil microbiome of mineral fertilisers in which part of the N, P, or K content comes from bio-based materials (BBMFs), namely ash, struvite, and a patented chemical process. The crop was maize, and a metataxonomic approach was used to assess the effect on the soil microbiome. The BBMF treatments were compared with a control treated with a conventional mineral fertiliser. The conventional fertiliser performed significantly better than the bio-based fertilisers in terms of maize biomass production at the first sampling point 60 days after sowing (DAS), but at the last sampling point, 90 DAS, the BBMFs showed comparable or even better biomass production than the conventional one. This suggests that BBMFs may have a slightly slower nutrient release rate. The use of fertiliser, whether conventional or BBMF, resulted in a significant increase in microbiome biodiversity (Shannon index), while it did not affect species richness. Interestingly, the use of fertilisers modulated the composition of the bacterial community, increasing the abundance of beneficial bacterial taxa considered to be plant-growth-promoting bacteria, without significant differences between the conventional mineral fertilisers and the BBMFs. The predominance of PGPRs in the rhizosphere of crops when BBMFs are used could be part of the reason why BBMFs perform similarly or even better than conventional fertilisers, even if the rate of nutrient release is slower. This hypothesis will be tested in future field trials. Thus, BBMFs are an interesting option to make the food chain more sustainable. \u00a9 2024 by the authors.",

The presence of various hydrophilic groups in the polymeric structure of SHC facilitates excellent water absorbency (> 100 times its own weight) and serves as an additional mini-water reservoir inside the soil matrix to maintain vegetation covers on geotechnical infrastructures under arid conditions. This state-of-the-art review aims to identify potential application of SHC to promote sustainable geotechnics through waste-to-resource conversion, development of self-sustaining green infrastructure, ecological restoration of polluted land, effective management of dredged soil, and development of composite barrier layer for underground waste containment facilities. The review paper identifies the thrust research areas in sustainable geotechnics and maps those with sustainable development goals (SDGs) formulated by United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2015. A brief description of SHC synthesis from various industrial, agricultural, and ocean waste is presented and classified the waste based on their composition for SHC synthesis. Efforts were made to develop critical understanding of soil\u2013water retention capacity and vegetation growth in SHC-amended soils. The current understanding and the gap in knowledge related to the ion adsorption ability and swelling of SHC under extreme environmental conditions (i.e., hyper-alkaline, hyper-acidic, and high saline) are discussed. The major research gaps and future perspectives of SHC in sustainable geotechnics are put forth that need to be addressed. \u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Indian Geotechnical Society 2024.",

This study investigated the effect of dietary pomegranate pulp in the total mixed ration of Ghezel lambs, evaluating its effect on growth performance, blood parameters, carcass traits, as well as meat quality and shelf life. 3-month-old Ghezel lambs (individually housed, n = 8) were randomly assigned to be either non-supplemented (control) or supplemented with 100 g/kg DM of sun-dried pomegranate pulp for 28 days, post-adjustment. Results showed that supplementation of lamb diets with pomegranate pulp significantly increased liveweight and average daily gains, while not significantly affecting dry matter intake. Lamb serum urea and alkaline phosphatase concentrations and hot carcass weight were increased with pomegranate pulp supplementation. Compared to control lambs, the meat from lambs fed the supplemented diet had higher concentrations of intramuscular fat, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid, total unsaturated fatty acid, and meat phenolic compounds. Pomegranate pulp supplemented lambs also had a higher ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids; and produced liver tissue with less fat and ash contents. Meat oxidative status (thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) and quality (water holding capacity, colour, and pH) were improved when lambs were supplemented with pomegranate pulp. These findings demonstrate that using pomegranate pulp as a feed for Ghezel lambs has advantageous effects on animal performance and meat quality, offering valorisation of an agrifood by-product. \u00a9 2024",

However, the cost and environmental consequences of traditional membrane synthesis, including the use of fossil-based polymers and toxic solvents are hindering their scaleup and large-scale adoption. Recognizing this, efforts to replace polymers with sustainable biopolymers and recycle/upcycle waste polymers are underway. Furthermore, the need to replace toxic solvents, such as hexane, with green alternatives, like deep eutectic solvents (DES), is being realized. Although the efficacy of using sustainable alternatives to membrane materials are reviewed in some studies, a comprehensive review that unifies these approaches has been lacking.

The work emphasizes the vast application potential of these environmentally responsible alternatives across various separation processes and highlights innovative techniques for waste valorization in membrane synthesis. While showcasing prospects, the review also identifies persistent challenges, particularly the dependency on fossil-based inputs.

The potential of combining RED/ED and RBMED/BMED as sustainable secondary batteries is also presented. Overall, it is concluded that increasing the membrane performance is a key aspect to rise the maturity of the proposed technologies along with their adaptation to the different characteristics of current and future waste streams potentially available for energy recovery and storage. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s)",

        "abstract": "Herein we study the economic performance of hydrochar and synthetic natural gas co-production from olive tree pruning. The process entails a combination of hydrothermal carbonization and methanation. In a previous work, we evidenced that standalone hydrochar production via HTC results unprofitable. Hence, we propose a step forward on the process design by implementing a methanation, adding value to the gas effluent in an attempt to boost the overall process techno-economic aspects. Three different plant capacities were analyzed (312.5, 625 and 1250 kg/hr). The baseline scenarios showed that, under the current circumstances, our circular economy strategy in unprofitable. An analysis of the revenues shows that hydrochar selling price have a high impact on NPV and subsidies for renewable coal production could help to boost the profitability of the process. On the contrary, the analysis for natural gas prices reveals that prices 8 times higher than the current ones in Spain must be achieved to reach profitability. This seems unlikely even under the presence of a strong subsidy scheme. The costs analysis suggests that a remarkable electricity cost reduction or electricity consumption of the HTC stage could be a potential strategy to reach profitability scenarios. Furthermore, significant reduction of green hydrogen production costs is deemed instrumental to improve the economic performance of the process. These results show the formidable techno-economic challenge that our society faces in the path towards circular economy societies. \u00a9 2023",

        "abstract": "Exorbitant greenhouse gas emissions associated with commercial sodium silicates (SS) have curtailed the large-scale practical implementation of geopolymers and have also led to discrepancies related to their sustainability. As a result, the extraction of SS from silica-rich biomass/agricultural waste ashes (AGWA) have gained the attention of researchers. This process involves heat treatment of AGWA with sodium hydroxide in addition to the calcination to produce the ash itself, thus requiring a systematic study to justify its sustainability. Therefore, this study presents an integrated techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) to determine the economic and environmental feasibility of AGWA-derived activators for geopolymer concrete synthesis. The LCA results showed a 60\u201362% reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions of commercial SS-based geopolymer. A significant improvement was also observed in photochemical ozone formation, wherein the emissions were lesser from binders using AGWA based SS as compared to binders produced with commercially available SS. The TEA indicated that although the AGWA-derived SS reduced the cost of the activator by 50\u201370%, the overall cost of geopolymer concrete with these activators was still higher than OPC based concrete. The hydrothermal process was found to have a lower CO2 emissions and production cost as compared to the thermochemical method to prepare AGWA-derived SS. All in all, the innovative valorization of biomass-waste-derived sodium silicate in geopolymer concrete has a lot of potential to foster a circular bioeconomy by closing the loop of agricultural waste and also promote circular construction by repurposing of waste materials in concrete. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "Sophorolipids (SLs) are promising biosurfactants that have gained significant attention due to their superior properties compared to their fossil-derived counterparts. However, the huge cost of the abstracts limits its massive production. This study investigates the viability of bakery waste oil (BWO) as an economically efficient and environmentally sustainable feedstock for SLs production. Although such waste valorisation minimizes the use of first-generation substrates, the systematic environmental impacts need to be assessed as the waste streams may introduce different materials and processes. For this reason, a dynamic life cycle assessment (dLCA) was employed to iteratively assess the environmental impacts of SLs production as technology evolved. To facilitate the comparison between each traversal, the functional unit (FU) is defined as the production of 1 kg of crude SLs. SimaPro software and Ecoinvent v3.5 database were used to perform the dLCA. Cumulative energy demand (CED), global warming potential (GWP), and ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint (H) methods were used as indicators. Surprisingly, this analysis reveals that the use of BWO as a feedstock for SLs production (15,803.3 MJ of CED and 1277.3 kg CO2 eq. of GWP) does not consistently lead to reduced environmental impacts compared to first-generation feedstocks like oleic acid (11,898.3 MJ of CED and 959.6 kg CO2 eq. of GWP). Then different pH regulators were added to improve the bioprocess and reduce the environmental impacts. Notably, the introduction of potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a pH regulator significantly decreased environmental footprints, with results showing a CED and GWP of 9301.1 MJ and 751.7 kg CO2 eq., respectively. In contrast, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) exacerbated these impacts, resulting in a higher CED (19,741.6 MJ) and GWP (1595.6 kg CO2 eq.). ReCiPe Midpoint results confirmed that the use of BWO significantly reduced the environmental impacts of chemicals, especially the first-generation feedstock, under the regulation of KOH. Finally, a comparison was made between the use of BWO and food waste as substrates, demonstrating that BWO has a greater potential for reducing environmental impact. Moreover, the study recommends that combining BWO and food waste, along with other productivity-enhancing techniques like fed-batch fermentation and in-situ separation, will further enhance the sustainability of SLs production. The findings from the dLCA framework provide valuable insights for achieving sustainable SLs production, simultaneously enhancing SLs yield and environmental friendliness. This study highlights the effectiveness of dLCA as a method to track and analyze emerging technologies, guiding them toward a sustainability pathway. \u00a9 2024",

In this study, sacha inchi and sinami oil-pressed cakes and cocoa bean shells were used to replace refined wheat flour in a traditional Peruvian bread. The aim of this research was to determine the physicochemical (color, texture, proximate composition, fatty acid profile and antioxidant capacity) and sensory parameters (external appearance, odor, taste, and texture) of different flatbread formulas. Results showed that reformulated bread presented a better nutritional profile, where its protein and fibre content stand out compared to traditional wheat flour sample. Besides, the lipidic profile is improved when by-product flours are used, and, in addition, in samples reformulated with cocoa flour and sinami, the content on polyphenols, DPPH and the antioxidant capacity increases considerably. The reformulation affects all the sensory parameters, but although the new formulas have obtained lower values for almost all the parameters, in general, almost all the samples present values above zero, which demonstrates the great acceptance of the reformulated samples. \u00a9 2024 The Authors",

        "abstract": "This study investigated converting abundant paper mill waste, de-inked paper sludge (DPS), into value-added medium-density fiberboard (MDF) panels. The objective was to repurpose this solid waste into a valuable material that aligns with the principles of a circular economy. Previous research has examined the addition of paper sludge to wood composites, but there is limited information on the specific incorporation of DPS into MDF production. This investigation offers new insights into this application. MDF panels were manufactured using hardwood fibers, with varying levels of urea-formaldehyde resin (10% and 12% by weight) and different loadings of DPS (ranging from 0% to 50% by weight). X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the presence of defective DPS fiber crystals. Contact angle measurements confirmed that DPS had poor wettability, corresponding to increased water absorption. As more DPS was incorporated, the mechanical properties of the panels progressively weakened due to defective fibers and poor adhesion between the fibers and the matrix. This was evident in scanning electron microscopy micrographs, which showed an escalation in interfacial flaws. Increasing the resin dosage noticeably improved the internal bond strength and reduced moisture uptake across all levels of DPS. However, at a DPS loading of 50%, the properties of the panels deteriorated by 36%\u201357% compared to the control MDF. Additionally, thickness swelling and water absorption increased significantly with higher DPS content, primarily due to the hydrophilic nature of the fibers. Based on optimization, it was determined that a DPS loading of 20% with a resin content of 12% provided the best balance between performance, waste utilization, cost, and moisture resistance. The reuse of abundant paper sludge supports the goals of a circular economy. However, strategies are required to tailor the processing methods and enable higher levels of recycled material without excessively compromising the key attributes of the product. Further research should focus on enhancing the quality of DPS and its compatibility with wood fibers and resin to enhance the performance of the composite material. Highlights: DPS from recycled paper mill assessed for MDF production with wood fibers and resin Increasing DPS loading caused reductions in strength and adhesion of panels Water absorption and thickness swelling markedly rose with more DPS addition It was attributed to hydrophilic fibers and disrupted fiber-matrix bonding Optimal formulation was 20% DPS loading and 12% resin content, balancing performance, waste utilization, and cost. \u00a9 2024 Society of Plastics Engineers.",

An alternative, consolidated bioprocessing, enables the direct conversion of agricultural biomass into amino acids using selected microorganisms.

        "abstract": "The transition from conventional landfill-centric waste management to resource-centric methodologies necessitates an enhanced comprehension of municipal solid waste (MSW) composition and its inherent value. Existing methodologies documented in the literature exhibit a lack of standardization, impending the formulation of a systematic engineering approach for MSW characterization and valuation. This study introduces a methodology specifically tailored to discern the composition of waste origination from urban households and evaluate its recyclability within the confines of a circular economy framework, Employing a volume-based measurement approach, aims to estimate the recycling value of waste materials. The study's outcomes contribute significantly to quantifying the potential recycling value that accrues to society. Furthermore, the validation of the proposed protocol elucidates the dynamic nature of recyclable value as it traverses the intricate pathways of the waste supply chain. This insight facilitates the formulation of commercial models grounded in circular economy principles for the effective management of household solid waste. Empirical findings reveal that the total recycling value fluctuates within the range of USD 3.39 and USD 5.76 per cubic meter of waste volume, contingent upon the specific waste composition at the experiment site. Additionally, the proposed methodology uncovers the nuanced variability in MSW composition and recycling value across diverse household collection patterns, identifying mixed plastic, paper, cardboard, mixed MSW, and clothing as primary constituents. The application of this methodology extends beyond mere quantification, providing a foundational framework for simulating the latent recycling value embedded within MSW samples. This, in turn, offers invaluable support to strategy developers, policymakers, and entrepreneurial ventures engaged in the sustainable management of household solid waste.

Pyrolysis may be an adequate way for its valorization. However, it would imply to know how the process takes place and if the removal of its natural detrital inorganic matter (epiphytes, marine salt and sand) is necessary, which are the objectives of this research. Pyrolysis by thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry was carried out on both the washed and unwashed samples. During this waste pyrolysis, the following occurs: (i) the high alkali metal chloride content promotes fragmentation reactions of carbohydrates and O formation, which increases HCOOH intensities at temperatures between 250 and 360 \u00b0C; (ii) from 500 \u00b0C to 650 \u00b0C, Fe2O3 and decomposition of carbonates seem to be involved in reactions that produce O release and steam and CO2 reforming of hydrocarbons and oxygenated organic compounds with H2 generation; (iii) from 650 \u00b0C to 750 \u00b0C, Fe2O3, high alkali metal content and carbonate decomposition generate char gasification, an increase in O release, SO2 capture and HCOOH formation. In general, the abundance of inorganic matter (chlorides, carbonates, etc.) minimizes the release of various compounds during pyrolysis, including SO2 and HCl, while increasing HCOOH production. Thus, this high content of inorganic matter may represent an advantage for its pyrolysis, producing value-added chemical products with a reduced environmental impact. Therefore, this study may be the starting point for defining the optimal pyrolysis conditions for this waste valorisation. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s)",

        "abstract": "The production of hydrogen from plastic and biomass waste via processes powered by renewable electricity can be a pivotal contributor to an effective waste management system in a circular economy. Copyrolysis of plastic and biomass waste mixtures can be economically appealing, not only by eliminating the need for waste stream separation but also by potentially synergizing hydrogen production. In this study, we present evidence of such hydrogen production synergy in plasma copyrolysis of mixtures of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and cellulose (CE) as plastic and biomass waste models, respectively. We treated samples made of mixtures of LDPE and CE powders at five different mass ratios, ranging from 100% LDPE to 100% CE. We used non-thermal nitrogen plasma and argon plasma in a Streamer Dielectric-Barrier Discharge (SDBD) configuration under atmospheric pressure conditions. Synergistic hydrogen production was observed when nitrogen was used as the working gas, but not with argon, resulting in up to 37% greater hydrogen production compared to non-synergistic expectations. This outcome is attributed to the nitrogen-doped oxygenated carbonaceous residues from CE pyrolysis catalyzing the dehydrogenation and reforming of light alkanes resulting from the decomposition of LDPE. \u00a9 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",

Plastic particles in products of this nature are too small to be retrieved during wastewater treatment and they accumulate in the environment, negatively impacting living organisms and ecosystems. Sustainable alternatives that offer comparable mechanical properties to synthetic plastic microbeads could be developed using biowaste material. Brewer's spent grain (BSG), the primary residue of the brewery industry, is shown herein to be a promising starting material in the development of biodegradable, nontoxic microbeads. After dilute acid hydrolysis, pretreated lignocellulosic pulp from BSG is solubilized using an aqueous system of NaOH and ZnO. Solid microbeads may then be formed by dropping the resulting solution into an acid bath, filtering, and drying. The conditions of each step required optimization to successfully produce spherical microbeads with a mean diameter as small as 1.25 mm, a homogeneous size distribution, and an average hardness of 199 MPa. The beads also demonstrated superior cleansing abilities to commercially available natural exfoliating particles. BSG microbeads are therefore a promising option for use as a physical exfoliating agent in various personal hygiene products. \u00a9 2024 The Authors.

This perspective seems to be a promising alternative for the valorization of wool waste. The reaction yield is calculated in every case in order to determine the optimum hydrolysis conditions. The solid residue, as well as the filtrate, are subjected to instrumental chemical analysis in order to identify and isolate useful products. The optimal conditions for the hydrolysis of wool resulted to be the use of 5% w/v NaOH, microwave treatment for 10 min in absence of phase-transfer catalyst. In addition, the analysis in the Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) allowed the identification of certain small molecules like N2, H2S, NH3, C6H5OH, C4H9NO and larger ones like amino acids, such as alanine, cystine, proline, valine and leucine.

The optimum synthesis parameters to maximize 4-NP reduction were an initial pH of 12.4 and a volume ratio of metal leachate to CFS of 1:3. These nanoparticles were found to be heteroatom-doped CuO/Cu2O (Bio-CuO/Cu2O-PCB) with spherical shape, average crystallite size of 19 nm and average particle size of 19.2 nm.

Second, the pandemic catalyzed a dichotomy in consumer behaviors\u2014panic buying initially increased waste, while hardship measures later encouraged sustainable waste reduction practices like meal planning and leftover use. Third, adopting a circular economy approach holds potential, yet its implementation remains limited in terms of curbing food waste and promoting sustainability in NENA. Overall, while the pandemic accentuated the urgency of tackling food waste, it also stimulated innovative policy thinking and strategic planning for building more resilient food systems. This paper concludes that leveraging pandemic-driven sustainability mindsets while addressing systemic drivers of waste will be key to mitigating food waste and its impacts moving forward. This paper offers timely insights into the evolving food waste management landscape in NENA, underscoring the need for integrated policies to navigate post-pandemic recovery effectively. \u00a9 2024 by the authors.",

        "abstract": "Activated carbon (AC) based adsorbents derived from waste sludge were utilized to remediate mixed contaminants in wastewater as an integrated waste-to-resource approach promoting a paradigm shift in management of refuse sludge and wastewater. This review specifically focuses on the remediation of constituents of landfill leachate by sludge-based activated carbon (SBAC). The adsorption effectiveness of SBAC for the exclusion of leachate characters including heavy metals, phenols, dyes, phosphates, and phosphorus were explored with regard to modifiers such as pH, temperature, properties of the adsorbent including functional groups, initial doses of absorbent and adsorbate, and duration of exposure to note the impact of each parameter on the efficiency of adsorption of the sludge adsorbent. Through the works of various researchers, it was noted that the properties of the adsorbent, pH and temperature impact the working of SBACs. The pH of the adsorbent by influencing the functional groups. Temperature was expected to have a paramount effect on the adsorption efficiency of the SBACs. The importance of the regeneration and recycling of the adsorbents as well as their leachability is highlighted. Sludge based activated carbon is recommended as a timely, resource-efficient, and sustainable approach for the remediation of wastewater. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the building industry has looked for technological ways to protect the environment and preserve natural resources. Since the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been a shortage of building materials, which has caused construction costs to go up. This has made it more important for sustainable development to be based on the principles of the circular economy. This gives an opportunity to utilise various reliable materials as substitutes, like construction and demolition (C&D) waste. (C&D) wastes are made up of a large chunk of all solid waste, which causes many environmental problems. The most important factor in the struggle against climate change is the reduction of CO2 emissions from the construction sector. At the same time, globally, climate change caused in part by carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is an important problem that requires innovative carbon sequestration strategies. Because C&D waste is alkaline-rich (e.g., calcium hydroxide and calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H)), it can be used to sequester CO2 by converting it into thermodynamically stable carbonates. Temperature, partial pressure of CO2, time, process route, humidity, and the water-to-solid ratio (w/s) can affect the CO2 sequestration over the C&D wastes. \u00a9 2024 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.",

        "abstract": "Background: Food waste (FW) typically comprises waste from households, food industries, and food outlets. It is mainly composed of fruit and vegetable residues, grain residues, meat and poultry waste, dairy waste, and seafood waste. FW is responsible for one-tenth of greenhouse gas emissions from the entire food system. This serious issue needs to be resolved as per the 12th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations (UN-SDG) for a sustainable food system. Scope and approach: Along with the current mitigation strategies, innovative technical interventions are required to achieve a zero-waste food system. FW is a rich source of several biomolecules, including protein, carbohydrates, oil, vitamins, bioactive compounds, and minerals. To extract such valuable biomolecules, upcycling FW is a need for the hour. A suitable pre-treatment method and FW bioconversion strategy are the key approaches for a circular bioeconomy. The upcycling of FW not only establishes a sustainable food system, but also provides several valuable products, such as biofuels, organic acids, biomaterials, bioactive compounds, biochar, bioenzymes, and biofabrics. Key findings and conclusions: The value-added products possess wide applications in the health, food, chemical, cosmetic, textile, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical industries. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a crucial approach for assessing the environmental impact of a system, product, or process. It constitutes all sides of a system, including social, economic, and environmental to minimize the waste at every step of processing. Therefore, it is crucial to develop and adopt innovative technologies to valorize FW for achieving and maintaining a self-sustainable future. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

Both treated fibers presented a higher degree of crystallinity, enhanced thermal resistance and also cleaner, rough, and defibrillated surface due to the removal of noncellulosic components, as was shown in scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectra, and x-ray diffraction (XRD) results. The SEW4 fibers were incorporated into the poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) matrix in contents up to 5% wt. through melt processing. PBAT/SEW4 composites were evaluated by their microstructure, thermal properties, degree of crystallinity, and hydrophilic behavior. XRD results showed PBAT/SEW4 composites with higher degrees of crystallinity and contact angle tests revealed increased composite hydrophobicity with the increase of SEW4 content in the PBAT matrix.

        "abstract": "Hydrothermal carbonization was applied to taro peel wastes to produce hydrochars using a facile and environmentally friendly process. Four different entities were prepared: hydrochar (TPh), phosphoric-activated hydrochar (P-TPh), and silver@hydrochars (Ag@TPh, Ag@P-TPh). The elemental compositions of the single and composite hydrochars were confirmed by EDX. Among the produced hydrochars, the morphology of the Ag@hydrochar composites demonstrated more wrinkled structure, and Ag nanoparticles decorated the surface. The optimal experimental conditions for levofloxacin adsorption were determined to be a contact time of 45 min, hydrochar dose of 0.15 g L\u22121, and pH of 7. The best adsorption performances were assigned to Ag@hydrochars. Two machine learning models were applied to predict the levofloxacin adsorption efficiency of the Ag@hydrochars. A central composite design (CCD) and a 3-10-1 artificial neural network (ANN) model were developed to estimate the removal performance of levofloxacin using Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm based on correlation and error analysis of the adopted training functions. Furthermore, the ANN sensitivity analysis revealed the order of the relative importance variable as initial concentration> hydrochar dose> pH. The predicted values of the CCD and ANN models fitted the experimental results with R2> 0.989. Therefore, the applied models were effective in predicting levofloxacin removal under different operating conditions. This work provides an open option for the sustainable management of food industry wastes and the possibility of waste valorization to effective hydrochar composites to be applied in water treatment processes. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "To reduce emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) have the potential to decarbonize the aviation sector. Redirecting wastes from conventional waste management practices and using them as cost-effective feedstocks for low-carbon fuels can reduce emissions from both waste disposal and fuel combustion. One approach is to upgrade wet wastes to SAF precursors, such as volatile fatty acids (VFAs). In this study, novel membrane-assisted arrested methanogenesis was developed to convert high-strength wastewater to VFAs. Based on experimental results of VFA production, techno-economic and life-cycle analyses were conducted to estimate the potential economic and environmental benefits of SAF production from high-strength wastewater via VFAs. By evaluating three proposed scenarios for VFA production, a minimum production cost of VFA is achieved at $0.60/kg VFA at a wastewater flow rate of 1100 MT/d. For the corresponding VFA-derived SAF, the estimated minimum fuel selling price is $4.64/gasoline gallon equivalent. The life-cycle analysis shows that up to a 71% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved relative to its fossil-counterpart along with lower water and fossil-fuel consumption. \u00a9 2024 UChicago Argonne, LLC, Operator of Argonne National Laboratory.

        "abstract": "This study evaluated the potential of a biocoagulant produced from prickly pear peel waste valorization and its use as a biocoagulant aid mixed with aluminum sulfate to remove turbidity in domestic wastewater. A central composite design (CCD) and a simplex lattice design (SLD) of two components (biocoagulant and aluminum sulfate) were developed to determine the optimal doses and pH of the biocoagulant and optimal mixing proportions. Both designs optimized the coagulation process from an analysis of variance to fit the experimental data to mathematical models and an optimization analysis to obtain the highest percentage of turbidity removal. The results showed that a water pH of 4 and a biocoagulant dose of 100 mg/L are optimal conditions for a turbidity removal of 76.1%. The potential decreases to 51.7% when the wastewater pH is maintained at 7.8 and a dose of 250 mg/L is used. This efficiency could be increased to 58.2% by using a mixture with optimal proportions of 30% biocoagulant and 70% aluminum sulfate. The experimental data were fitted to two quadratic models, estimating model prediction errors of 0.42% and 2.34%, respectively. Therefore, these results support the valorization of prickly pear peel waste to produce a biocoagulant, which could be used in acid and alkaline wastewater or as a biocoagulant aid mixed with aluminum sulfate. \u00a9 2024 by the authors.",

In this regard, one need to take actions on food-derived waste management roadmap toward a circular and sustainable society. Therefore, this food-derived waste issue can be aligned with the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Scope and approach: This work focused on the analysis of the updated database related to the food-derived waste generation, GHG emissions, relevant regulations, and policies/roadmaps for SDGs in Taiwan. In addition, there are four case studies in food-derived waste valorization for producing value-added products as the business models in Taiwan. Key findings and conclusions: Under the regulatory measures for food-derived waste valorization in Taiwan, the contribution percentages of GHG emissions from the waste sector indicated a declining trend, decreasing from about 1.5% in 2010 to about 0.9% in 2021. In addition, the government also declared the corresponding SDG indicators in connection with the food loss & waste reduction and organic farming, thus stepping towards a circular bio-economy and sustainable society. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",

        "abstract": "Background: The increase in fish processing has led to the production of a substantial amount of waste. Sustainable resource management increasingly recognizes the need to use fish and fishery wastes to manufacture edible food items. The utilization of innovative technology for the transformation of fishery waste materials into food-useable ingredients is being studied. Scope and approach: The purpose of this review is to highlight the current advances in the incorporation of fish and fisheries waste in food formulations. This paper looks at the different safety and quality issues associated with the integration of these waste materials into food products and their impact on food quality and consumer acceptance. The regulations pertaining to the incorporation of fishing waste-derived substances into food formulations are also discussed. Key findings and conclusions: Despite the growing incorporation of fish and fisheries waste components into various food products, there is limited research and regulatory guidelines addressing the safety considerations associated with this practice. The current emphasis on waste utilization has prompted numerous studies that prioritize the examination of safety elements associated with the presence of pollutants, germs, and hazardous chemicals coming from these materials that have the potential to pose harm to human health. Legislations must be formulated taking into account the appropriateness of particular waste-derived materials for use in food, together with an evaluation of their potential effects on human health. \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd",
