The hydrophobic property of polystyrene has a potential to create a superhydrophobic surface. Here, we use expanded polystyrene waste to coat surfaces in two different ways—spray coating and dip coating—to produce superhydrophobic surfaces for food packaging. The ZnO was employed to make the surface rougher. However, the combination of ZnO and EPS waste produces only a hydrophobic surface. For spray coating and dip coating, the maximum water contact angle is 119° and 125° respectively. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) picture reveals many holes that increase the surface's roughness. The hydrophobic surface significantly cuts down on cleaning time. According to the food packaging parameter test mandated by the Indonesian Food and Drug Administration (BPOM) (BPOM regulation No. 20, 2019), the coating complies with heavy metals and ethanol stimulant migration testing requirements for food packaging. However, the migration condition in acetic acid stimulant surpasses the maximum standard. The total migration in 3% acetic acid stimulant (40°C for 10 days) is 22.95 mg/dm2 while the maximum value is 10 mg/dm2. "

This study aims to technically support reduction of Portland cement consumption in the manufacture of nonstructural masonry units, generally known as hollow concrete blocks (HCBs), by replacing cement with waste products obtained from the chemical industry in Mexico. Consequently, mortars with fresh waste material from the warehouse that complied with compressive strength requirements of current standards were prepared with which the masonry units were manufactured. The HCBs exhibited low water absorption owing to lower porosity, and their thermal conductivity was slightly superior to that of the commercially available units. The compressive strengths of the walls manufactured with these masonry units indicated that they are suitable for commercial use. Finally, the novelty of this research focuses on the fact that the waste material used has a minimal pre-treatment to design mixtures for producing hollow concrete blocks (HCBs), intending to reduce the carbon footprint of the final product by cutting down on treatment conventional practices like drying, cleaning, and the need to use more Portland cement to increase the compressive strength of HCB. Also, the methodological examination of microstructural characterization techniques applied to the waste material in question has been instrumental in enhancing its utilization and compliance with current specifications.

The strain showed great biodegradation potential under batch shake flask and stirred tank reactor. Bacterial growth was considerably inhibited at initial BPA concentrations > 50 mg/L. Further, membrane bioreactor (MBR) for BPA biodegradation was also evaluated under different inlet BPA concentration and hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the maximum BPA removal efficiency of 94.4 % was attained with an influent BPA concentration of 25 mg/L at 5 d of HRT. MBR also showed better performance under shock loading conditions. Identification of BPA biodegraded pathways was also performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, elucidating the different metabolites and end products formed. A subsequent enhancement in BPA removal efficieny was also observed owing to the microfiltration system of MBR that was applied to separate bacterial biomass from effluent. The maximum removal efficiency was further enhanced to 98.5 % under the same operational schedule. As the strain has the ability to produce extracellular diol synthase enzyme which transforms oleic acid into the biopolyol 7,10-dihydroxy-8(E)-octadecenoic acid, the effluent containing the enzymes was supplemented with 1 % (v/v) oleic acid under whole cell and cell-free approaches. Cell-free technique showed an enhanced bioconversion efficiency in comparison to the traditional whole cell approach. Further, the produced biopolyol was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analyses and also depicted the antibacterial activity.

text = "Agriculture and industries related to the agriculture sector generate a large amount of waste each year. These wastes are usually burned or dumped, causing damage to the environment, the economy and society. Due to their composition, they have great potential for obtaining high value-added products in biorefineries. This fact, added to the growing demand for energy and chemicals from fossil resources, is driving the interest of the scientific community in them. Biorefinery processes are hardly profitable when applied individually, so a better alternative is to develop integrated multi-feedstock and multi-product biorefinery schemes using all biomass fractions in a zero-waste approach. However, for industrial scale application, extensive research, scale-up studies, and techno-economic and environmental feasibility analyses are needed. This review compiles information on integrated multi-biorefinery processes from agro-industrial wastes to shed light on the path towards sustainable development and circular bioeconomy. 2024 The Authors"

In this situation, a sustainable and circular economy model is necessitated to mitigate global environmental issues. Production of biowaste from various processing industries also creates environmental issues which would be valorized for the production of industrially important reactive and bioactive compounds. Lignin acts as a vital part in biowaste composition which can be converted into a wide range of phenolic compounds. The phenolic compounds have attracted much attention, owing to their influence on diverse not only organoleptic parameters, such as taste or color, but also active agents for active packaging systems. Crop residues of varied groups, which are an affluent source of lignocellulosic biomass could serve as a renewable resource for the biosynthesis of ferulic acid (FA). FA is obtained by the FA esterase enzyme action, and it can be further converted into various tail end phenolic flavor green compounds like vanillin, vanillic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid. Lignin being renewable in nature, processing and management of biowastes towards sustainability is the need as far as the global industrial point is concerned. This review explores all the approaches for conversion of lignin into value-added phenolic compounds that could be included to packaging applications. These valorized products can exhibit the antioxidant, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, and due to these features can emerge to incorporate them into production of functional foods and be utilization of them at active food packaging application. These approaches would be an important step for utilization of the recovered bioactive compounds at the nutraceutical and food industrial sectors. "

In this study, we introduce an innovative chemical[sbnd]biological approach for transforming waste polyethylene into valuable biosurfactants.

This optimization ensures maximum feed availability for subsequent microbial processes. Notably, the produced chemical intermediates are directly utilized in the biological phase, eliminating the need for intermediate processing. Gordonia sp. JW21, selected for its exceptional alkane degradation capabilities, efficiently metabolizes a wide range of alkane structures, including extended alkyl chains. The microbial process culminates in the generation of high-value biosurfactants.

We conducted a case study involving the pyrolysis of coconut husk to create a sustainable pathway for its valorization. To enhance environmental compatibility, carbon dioxide (CO2) was employed as the reaction medium. CO2 acted as a partial oxidant, leading to the oxidation of carbons in the bio-oil and the formation of carbon monoxide (CO). In detail, this study experimentally proved the mechanistic contribution of CO2 to shifting carbon in pyrogenic oil into gases, particularly CO. To enhance the reactivity of CO2, the catalytic pyrolysis of coconut husk was conducted using a nickel-based egg-shell-type (Ni-ES) catalyst. Catalyst introduction resulted in the increased concentration of syngas compared with conditions without a catalyst in the presence of CO2. In particular, syngas production from catalytic pyrolysis under CO2 conditions was enhanced by >6.5-fold compared with that from single-stage pyrolysis under N2 conditions. Simultaneously, the evolution of pyrogenic oil was significantly reduced under CO2 condition in the presence of the Ni-ES catalyst. This confirms the catalytic potential in further optimizing the valorization of agricultural residues for sustainable energy production. 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, their conventional production relies heavily on fossil raw materials, necessitating sustainable alternatives. Waste activated sludge (WAS) can serve as a renewable feedstock for SCFA production through oxidative hydrothermal pretreatment. Thus, the aim of this work was to optimize the production and recovery of SCFAs from partially oxidised WAS. To achieve this, WAS was treated by wet oxidation (WO) at different temperatures (160–200 °C) and ultrafiltered using ceramic membranes (50 and 1 kDa) to pre-purify the SCFAs. Subsequently, these acids were extracted with different combinations of trioctylamine (TOA), tributylphosphate (TBP) and octan-1-ol in the temperature range 25–50 °C. WO at 160 °C for 240 min maximized the SCFA production, obtaining a concentration of 6.07 g/L, with acetic acid as the main component (28.2 %). Membrane ultrafiltration operating in total recycle mode achieved rejections of 39% for TOC and 73% for colour, with a low SCFA rejection (4%) effectively pre-purifying the SCFAs present in the WAS. The main fouling mechanism was cake formation. The highest extraction yields of SCFAs at room temperature were achieved with a mixture of TOA and TBP at 10 % in octan-1-ol, extracting 34 % of the total SCFAs present in the 1 kDa permeate. Lower extraction yields were obtained with the pre-purified WAS compared to synthetic solutions of SCFAs, showing the detrimental effect of the matrix in liquid–liquid extraction. Increasing the temperature within the range of 25–50 °C generally had a favourable effect on the SCFA extraction.

text = "Recycling aluminium in a rotary furnace with salt-fluxes allows recovering valuable alloys from hard-to-recycle waste/side-streams such as packaging, dross and incinerator bottom ash. However, this recycling route generates large amounts of salt-slag/salt-cake hazardous wastes which can pose critical environmental risks if landfilled. To tackle this issue, the metallurgical industry has developed processes to valorise the salt-slag residues into recyclable salts and aluminium concentrates, while producing by-products such as ammonium sulphate and non-metallic compounds (NMCs), with applications in the construction or chemical industries. This study aims to assess through LCA the environmental impacts of recycling aluminium in rotary furnaces for both salt-slag management routes: valorisation or landfill. It was found that this recycling process brings forth considerable net environmental profits, which increase for all the considered impact categories if the salt-slag is valorised. The main benefits arise from the production of secondary cast aluminium alloys, which is not unexpected due to the high energy intensity of aluminium primary production. However, the LCA results also identify other hotspots which play a significant role, and which should be considered for the optimisation of the process based on its environmental performance, such as the production of by-products, the consumption of energy/fuels and the avoidance of landfilling waste. Additionally, the assessment shows that the indicators for mineral resource scarcity, human carcinogenic toxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity are particularly benefited by the salt-slag valorisation. Finally, a sensitivity analysis illustrates the criticality of the metal yield assumptions when calculating the global warming potential of aluminium recycling routes. 2024 The Author(s)"

You can extract the relevant information from the text using regular expressions and natural language processing techniques. Here's an example of how you could do it:

```python
import re

# Existing dictionary
w2r = {"waste": [], "transforming_process": [], "transformed_resource": []}

text = "This study proposes an environmentally sustainable approach for converting food waste into fuels and chemicals, especially focusing on syngas production. The carbon-negative aspect of the pyrolysis process was achieved by employing CO2 as the reaction medium. Carrot pulp waste (CPW) was used as an exemplary food waste in this work. In the single-stage pyrolysis of CPW, the presence of CO2 led to improved syngas generation. The introduction of CO2, rather than N2 carrier gas, resulted in substantial increase of CO formation at temperatures ≥ 400 °C, with a decrease in bio-oil production. This phenomenon was due to the chemical reactions between CO2 and the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced during the pyrolysis of CPW. Specifically, CO2 played a mechanistic role by providing an extra oxygen source for CO production and participating in the oxidative thermal cracking of VOCs. In-depth analysis of multi-stage pyrolysis verified the mechanistic role of CO2, particularly at temperatures ≥ 190 °C. However, CO2-induced reactions influenced the molecular size of the VOCs. To boost the CO2-induced reactions for additional syngas formation, a nickel-based catalyst was introduced during the pyrolysis of CPW, which effectively expedited the homogeneous reactions initiated by CO2, thereby indicating its potential to accelerate and optimize food waste valorization. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In this code:

*   The `extract_info` function uses regular expressions to find the relevant information in the text.
*   It extracts the waste type from the text and returns it as a string.
*   It searches for specific processes mentioned in the text, like pyrolysis or thermal cracking, and stores them as strings within a list.
*   Finally, it identifies the transformed resources mentioned in the text (like syngas, fuels, or chemicals) and stores them as strings within another list.

        text = "Waste plastic (WP) and lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) are both refractory polymers that can provide feedstocks for the production of fuels. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a widely recognized technology utilized in waste management and renewable energy production. It involves the utilization of microorganisms to decompose organic matter into methane (CH4). Nevertheless, mono-digestion, which refers to AD utilizing a single feedstock, encounters difficulties related to the properties of the feedstock. Therefore, the utilization of co-digestion with multiple feedstocks provides the potential to overcome these limitations. This study might be the first to examine the impact of co-digestion of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with rice straw (RS) for biogas and CH4 production. The cumulative CH4 production for AD-1, AD-2, AD-3, AD-4, AD-5, and AD-6 was 154.9, 177.4, 52.0, 81.2, 98.43, and 135.15 NmL/g VS. The methane energy yields varied between 2.29 and 7.64 MJ/m3, while their respective βece values spanned from 17.6 to 58.8 %. Volatile solid removal was enhanced for the treated RS-LDPE mixture, as demonstrated in AD-6, in comparison to the untreated substrate in the AD-2 digester. There is a notable disparity in the composition of bacterial communities within the bioreactors that were constructed prior to and subsequent to the AD process. The proliferating Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Protobacteria were crucial to the AD of RS and LDPE. The three predominant methanogenic genera present in the constructed digesters and inoculum were Methanobacterium, Methanolinea, and Methanosarcina, each with a distinct abundance level. The findings open up the possibility of better understanding the effect of co-digestion of WP and LCB on enhancing CH4 production, which is critical for developing strategies for bioremediation and waste valorization simultaneously with biofuel production.
