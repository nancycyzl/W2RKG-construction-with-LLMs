Within this framework, the recycling and potential reutilization of textile residues can improve the pre- and post-cracking performance of cement-based matrices intended for building components with up to intermediate structural responsibilities (i.e., panels and cladding elements for buildings). This research is focused on the mechanical and durability -through forced aging of dry-wet and freeze-thaw cycles- experimental characterization of laminated fabric-reinforced cementitious matrices (FRCMs) containing 4 and 6 nonwoven fabric layers obtained from end-of-life fire-protecting t-shirts. For this purpose, both direct and flexural tensile tests were conducted to characterize the mechanical performance of the composite. The tests on the 6-fabric layers produced panels with Portland Cement (PC) matrix, after 28-day of curing, led to average values of the maximum tensile strength of 3.7 MPa with associated toughness index superior to 25 kJ/m2, and mean modulus of rupture of 11.6 MPa with a fracture energy index of 4.3 kJ/m2. After dry-wet accelerated aging, the post-cracking performance of the developed composites decreased (on average, 40% in toughness and 11% in strength) due to fiber embrittlement. To better understand the performance of aged composites, shredded fibers recovered from protective clothing (mainly consisting of meta-aramid fibers) were immersed in the binary matrix. Accordingly, the mechanical properties of the fibers after 5 and 10 cycles of dry-wet aging were studied. Based on the results, replacing partially PC by silica fume (between 30% and 50%) was seen as a sustainable alternative to improve the performance of the aged fibers by more than 10%.

Overall, the study aims at progressing towards the fine-tuning of the pyrolysis-reforming technology by co-feeding O2. Thus, a multi-point O2 injection system has been developed to ensure a suitable O2 distribution in the reforming reactor and avoid the formation of hot spots, as they may cause catalyst deactivation by metal sintering. Moreover, as O2 is directly supplied into the catalytic bed, pre-combustion of the volatile stream before contacting the catalyst is avoided and in-situ coke combustion is promoted. The P-OSR of HDPE was carried out in a two-step reaction system, which combines CSBR (conical spouted bed reactor) and FBR (fluidized bed reactor) technologies. The experiments were conducted in continuous mode and the influence of the main process conditions at zero time on stream was analyzed. Thus, the effect of reforming temperature was studied in the 550–750 °C range, that of the space time from 3.12 to 15.62 gcat min gHDPE−1, steam to plastic (S/P) ratio between 2 and 5 and equivalence ratio (ER) from 0 to 0.3. Under the optimum conditions (700 °C, S/P of 3, 12.5 gcat min gHDPE−1 and ER of 0.2), a H2 production of 25.0 wt% was obtained, which is only 28.6 % lower than that obtained in the conventional pyrolysis-steam reforming (P-SR) process. The results obtained confirm the potential of continuous P-OSR process for the selective production of H2. "

A simulation model using Aspen Plus, developed from experimental investigations to assess the viability of this proposed system. Furthermore, this model has been utilized to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) prediction model. Process sustainability analysis demonstrated an energy efficiency of 64 % while economic viability up to 80 % process efficiency with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 6 % and a payback period of 2107 days. An optimization strategy and an artificial neural network (ANN)-based predictive model have been developed. Optimization results revealed that a gasifier temperature of around 600 °C, a gasifying agent ratio of 2.0, and an acetaldehyde reactor temperature of 300 °C yield better process outcomes and revenue. The ANN model exhibited robust performance with coefficient of determination (R2) values ranging from 0.92 to 0.98 for acetaldehyde, hydrogen, and total revenue. Mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) fell within the range of 0.03–0.1 and 0.1–1.12 %, respectively. Consequently, given the favorable sustainability and predictive model performance, this study can be used for similar endeavors. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This study proposed a hydrothermal coupled pyrolysis process to control the element transfer in digestate during biochar production. The efficient reduction of NOX emissions and the improvement of biochar adsorbability were realized. The hydrothermal process reduced the nitrogen content in solid digestate by 49.10 %–81.79 %, thus reducing the NOX precursors in syngas and the N-containing substances in bio-oil. Additionally, the specific surface area and the total pore volume of biochar were enhanced from 25 m2/g to 60–73 m2/g and 0.06 cm3/g to 0.12–0.14 cm3/g, respectively. More defects, oxygen-containing functional groups, and doped Ca on the biochar resulted in a high phosphate removal efficiency of 94 %. The proposed technology provides an efficient and environmentally friendly way to utilize the digestate.

For this purpose, an UV conversion method for transforming the 7-dehydrocholesterol, highly present in fish, in vitamin D3 has been optimized.

An adaptive laboratory evolution strategy (ALE) has been carried out to improve the yield of the process. 
After 200 generations, two evolved strains were selected that showed reduced lag phase and enhanced poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and H2 synthesis compared to the parental strain. 
Genomic analysis of the photo-adapted (PA) variants showed four genes with single point mutations, including the photosynthesis gene expression regulator PpsR. 
The proteome of the variants suggested that the adapted variants overproduced H2 due to a more efficient CO oxidation through the CO-dehydrogenase enzyme complex and confirmed that energy acquisition was enhanced through overexpression of the photosynthetic system and metal cofactors essential for pigment biosynthesis.

The MCFAs primarily comprised n-caproate and n-caprylate, representing 41.5 % and 54.3 % of the total MCFAs, respectively. Utilization efficiencies for ethanol and acetate were nearly complete at 100 % and 92.8 %, respectively. Key microbial taxa identified under these optimal conditions included Alcaligenes, SRB2, Sporanaerobacter, and Kurthia, which were instrumental in critical pathways such as the generation of acetyl-CoA, the initial carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, the fatty acid biosynthesis cycle, and energy metabolism. This research provides a theoretical and technical blueprint for converting waste sludge into valuable MCFAs, promoting sustainable waste-to-resource strategies. "

This study aims to produce a cleaner approach to recycling solid waste sludge from water treatment plants into eco-friendly construction materials. This approach involves the production of structural sintering clay bricks using WTS as a substitute for clay in the manufacturing process. Various mixtures of WTS content ranging from 10% to 50% and sand content of 10 and 20% were investigated. The Brick samples were shaped in the form of cubes and then fired in an oven at 700 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, several tests were conducted on the fired brick samples, including compressive strength, bulk density, water absorption, apparent porosity, efflorescence, freeze and thaw analysis, and microstructure investigation. The properties of WTS indicate a high concentration of silica, aluminum, and iron, which contribute to the improved properties of the fired bricks. It was observed that the bricks' compressive strength decreased from 29.8 to 8 MPa as the WTS content increased from 10% to 50%. In parallel, increasing the WTS content resulted in a decrease in bulk density from 1.005 to 0.75 g/cm3, an increase in apparent porosity values from 20% to 35%, and a higher water absorption from 12% to 37%. Furthermore, the addition of sand by 10 and 20% to the bricks leads to enhancements in both the mechanical and microstructure properties of the sintered bricks. Moreover, the efflorescence analysis of bricks is at a slight level. It can be concluded that WTS can be reused in the manufacturing of structural sintering clay bricks, providing a cleaner and more sustainable method of disposal for water treatment sludge.

Different mixtures were prepared based on sediments and marble waste, and treated with hydraulic binders. The first mixture consisted solely of raw sediment, while the second mixture combined 50 % dredged sediments with 50 % marble waste. Additionally, this mixture was treated with 1 % aerial hydrated lime and hydraulic road binder to enhance its properties. The experimental study focused on assessing both the short-term and long-term mechanical properties of the prepared mixtures. Results highlighted that the mixtures containing dam sediments and marble waste were highly suitable for road subgrade construction. These mixtures satisfied the criteria for trafficability (UCS), wetting resistance (UCSI), freezing resistance (ITS), and overall mechanical strength. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the mixtures' microstructure and their environmental impact was conducted. A significant relationship was observed between CaO/SiO2 ratio and the mechanical properties of the treated mix. The research contributes to the growing body of knowledge regarding sustainable construction practices by highlighting the viability of utilizing dredged sediments and marble waste as valuable resources in road subgrade construction. The study showed that recovering 20 % of sediment and marble waste to replace natural materials would reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 % and 28 % respectively. "

text = "This study proposes an environmentally sustainable approach for converting food waste into fuels and chemicals, especially focusing on syngas production. The carbon-negative aspect of the pyrolysis process was achieved by employing CO2 as the reaction medium. Carrot pulp waste (CPW) was used as an exemplary food waste in this work. In the single-stage pyrolysis of CPW, the presence of CO2 led to improved syngas generation. The introduction of CO2, rather than N2 carrier gas, resulted in substantial increase of CO formation at temperatures ≥ 400 °C, with a decrease in bio-oil production. This phenomenon was due to the chemical reactions between CO2 and the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced during the pyrolysis of CPW. Specifically, CO2 played a mechanistic role by providing an extra oxygen source for CO production and participating in the oxidative thermal cracking of VOCs. In-depth analysis of multi-stage pyrolysis verified the mechanistic role of CO2, particularly at temperatures ≥ 190 °C. However, CO2-induced reactions influenced the molecular size of the VOCs. To boost the CO2-induced reactions for additional syngas formation, a nickel-based catalyst was introduced during the pyrolysis of CPW, which effectively expedited the homogeneous reactions initiated by CO2, thereby indicating its potential to accelerate and optimize food waste valorization. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a widely recognized technology utilized in waste management and renewable energy production. It involves the utilization of microorganisms to decompose organic matter into methane (CH4). Nevertheless, mono-digestion, which refers to AD utilizing a single feedstock, encounters difficulties related to the properties of the feedstock. Therefore, the utilization of co-digestion with multiple feedstocks provides the potential to overcome these limitations. This study might be the first to examine the impact of co-digestion of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) with rice straw (RS) for biogas and CH4 production. The cumulative CH4 production for AD-1, AD-2, AD-3, AD-4, AD-5, and AD-6 was 154.9, 177.4, 52.0, 81.2, 98.43, and 135.15 NmL/g VS. The methane energy yields varied between 2.29 and 7.64 MJ/m3, while their respective βece values spanned from 17.6 to 58.8 %. Volatile solid removal was enhanced for the treated RS-LDPE mixture, as demonstrated in AD-6, in comparison to the untreated substrate in the AD-2 digester. There is a notable disparity in the composition of bacterial communities within the bioreactors that were constructed prior to and subsequent to the AD process. The proliferating Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Protobacteria were crucial to the AD of RS and LDPE. The three predominant methanogenic genera present in the constructed digesters and inoculum were Methanobacterium, Methanolinea, and Methanosarcina, each with a distinct abundance level. The findings open up the possibility of better understanding the effect of co-digestion of WP and LCB on enhancing CH4 production, which is critical for developing strategies for bioremediation and waste valorization simultaneously with biofuel production. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"
