The article explores a new strategy for treating waste rubber, specifically emulsion type butadiene-based rubbers, which were previously not addressed due to their different molecular structure.

This research opens up possibilities for recycling all types of emulsion type diene-based rubbers.

It appears that you want me to continue writing in the style of a scientific research paper. Here is the continuation:

**Conclusion**

The results of this study demonstrate the importance of selecting an optimal combination of carbon and nitrogen sources for ABE fermentation to achieve high butanol production yields while minimizing costs. The identification of Thai molasses (M2) as a suitable carbon source, combined with corn steep liquor (CSL), as a nitrogen source, offers significant advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and fermentation efficiency. Moreover, the use of insect peptone derived from enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE) presents an attractive alternative to traditional nitrogen sources, such as CSL. However, caution must be exercised when using acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA), as its inhibitory properties can negatively impact fermentation outcomes.

**Recommendations**

Based on the findings of this study, we recommend the following:

1. The use of Thai molasses (M2) as a carbon source for ABE fermentation due to its cost-effectiveness and high sucrose content.
2. The combination of M2 with corn steep liquor (CSL) as a nitrogen source to achieve optimal butanol production yields.
3. The adoption of enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE) as an alternative nitrogen source, replacing traditional sources such as CSL or acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA).

**Future Research Directions**

Further research is warranted to investigate the potential benefits and limitations of using different types of molasses and insect peptones in ABE fermentation. Additionally, studies on the scalability and reproducibility of our findings are necessary to ensure that these results can be translated into industrial applications.
