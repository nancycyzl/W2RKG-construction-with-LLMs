The study found that:

* Utilizing recycled fibers from end-of-life fire-protecting t-shirts can improve the pre- and post-cracking performance of cement-based matrices.
* Laminated fabric-reinforced cementitious matrices (FRCMs) containing 4 and 6 nonwoven fabric layers showed promising mechanical properties:

Here's a summary of the results:

The application of EPS waste as a functional material was explored, and superhydrophobic surfaces were created using spray coating and dip coating methods.

The surface roughness increased due to the formation of holes, as observed in the SEM picture. However, the food packaging coating failed to meet the standards set by the Indonesian Food and Drug Administration (BPOM), specifically for migration testing in acetic acid stimulant (22.95 mg/dm2 vs 10 mg/dm2 maximum standard).

Here is a rewritten version of the paragraph in a formal tone:

This study examines the economic viability of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation by investigating various carbon and nitrogen sources for the production of biobutanol. Four local molasses (M1, M2, M3, and M4) were evaluated as potential carbon sources, while three nitrogen sources - corn steep liquor (CSL), acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA), and enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE) - were considered. The results show that a combination of Thai molasses (M2) and corn steep liquor (CSL) is an effective and cost-efficient medium for ABE fermentation, yielding a butanol concentration of 7.4 ± 3.5 g/L. Furthermore, this study highlights the impact of different molasses on sucrose consumption inhibition and identifies insect peptone derived from enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE) as a promising alternative nitrogen source. However, caution is advised against using insect peptone obtained from acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA), due to its inhibitory properties.

This study explores the use of waste from kraft pulp mills (lime sludge and lime slaker grits) to produce magnesium oxysulfate-based fiber cement boards, a more sustainable alternative to traditional cement.

Key findings:

* Replacing 25% of limestone with grits showed no noticeable differences in board properties.
* However, using LS or higher concentrations of grits led to decreased physical-mechanical performance due to the formation of Na2SO4.XH2O and ITZ structure around aggregated particles.
* Accelerated carbonation in a saturated atmosphere caused the carbonation of the 5–1–7 phase, leading to reduced mechanical strength after curing.
* Thermal decomposition of Hydrated Magnesium Carbonates (HMCs) formed during accelerated carbonation contributed to changes in physical properties and reduced water absorption of the boards.

Implications:

* Valorizing waste from kraft pulp mills can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote a more circular economy.
* Magnesium oxysulfate-based fiber cement boards offer a sustainable alternative to traditional cement, with potential for further optimization through process improvements.
