**Results**

Our study has identified an optimal medium for acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation using various carbon and nitrogen sources. Specifically, we found that a combination of Thai molasses (M2) and corn steep liquor (CSL), denoted as M2CSL, is a cost-effective and efficient medium for ABE fermentation.
