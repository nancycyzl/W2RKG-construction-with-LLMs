The study investigated the pyrolysis characteristics of bio-wastes (date pits, peanut shells, coffee grounds, and tea waste) and their blends to identify the best combination for producing char or hydrogen-rich gas.

Key findings:

* Pyrolysis favored liquid production, ranging from 34.31% (tea waste) to 50.92% (date pits).
* Co-pyrolysis increased gaseous product, ranging between 42.02% (tea waste-date pits) and 55.17% (peanut shells-tea waste).
* Blending coffee grounds and peanut shells resulted in heightened reactivity, leading to enhanced H2 generation (34.44%).
* The optimal mixture was found to be coffee grounds-tea waste, showing superior performance in gas quality (38.39% H2) and yield (53.74%).
* Biochars from the recovered waste have potential as solid fuels, biofertilizers, or carbon materials.
* They could also serve as eco-friendly precursors for chemical industries.

The research found that:

* Laminated fabric-reinforced cementitious matrices (FRCMs) containing recycled nonwoven fabric from end-of-life fire-protecting t-shirts can achieve high mechanical performance.
