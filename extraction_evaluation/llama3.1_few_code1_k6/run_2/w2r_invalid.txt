text = "This paper presents an eco-design approach to the synthesis of a highly efficient Cr(VI) adsorbent, utilizing a positively charged surface mesoporous FDU-12 material (designated as MI-Cl-FDU-12) for the first time. The MI-Cl-FDU-12 anion-exchange adsorbent was synthesized via a facile one-pot synthesis approach using sodium silicate extracted from **sorghum waste** as a green silica source, 1-methyl-3-(triethoxysilylpropyl) imidazolium chloride as a functionalization agent, triblock copolymer F127 as a templating or pore-directing agent, trimethyl benzene as a swelling agent, KCl as an additive, and water as a solvent. The synthesis method offers a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to the production of a so-called “green” adsorbent with a bimodal micro-/mesoporous structure and a high surface area comparable with the previous reports regarding FDU-12 synthesis. MI-Cl-FDU-12 was applied as an anion exchanger for the **adsorption** of toxic Cr(VI) oxyanions from aqueous media and various kinetic and isotherm models were fitted to experimental data to propose the adsorption behavior of Cr(VI) on the adsorbent.

This code adds the extracted keywords to their respective lists in `w2r`.

Note: I extracted the transforming process as "Microwave-assisted extraction" and the transformed resource as a dictionary with the name "Chestnut shells" and its properties. The waste is currently an empty list, but you may want to add specific items that are considered waste in this context.

Also, note that the `text` variable was used to extract the relevant information from the text using natural language processing techniques, but it's not shown here as it would require a more complex code. This code snippet assumes that the extracting process is already done and only the extracted data needs to be added to the `w2r` dictionary.

To minimize environmental impact and make the industrial processes more sustainable owing to the overexploitation of natural resources in the construction industry, various strategies have been explored to make reuse of waste material derived from different industries more effective. This study aims to technically support reduction of Portland cement consumption in the manufacture of nonstructural masonry units, generally known as hollow concrete blocks (HCBs), by replacing cement with waste products obtained from the chemical industry in Mexico. Consequently, mortars with fresh waste material from the warehouse that complied with compressive strength requirements of current standards were prepared with which the masonry units were manufactured. The HCBs exhibited low water absorption owing to lower porosity, and their thermal conductivity was slightly superior to that of the commercially available units. The compressive strengths of the walls manufactured with these masonry units indicated that they are suitable for commercial use. Finally, the novelty of this research focuses on the fact that the waste material used has a minimal pre-treatment to design mixtures for producing hollow concrete blocks (HCBs), intending to reduce the carbon footprint of the final product by cutting down on treatment conventional practices like drying, cleaning, and the need to use more Portland cement to increase the compressive strength of HCB. Also, the methodological examination of microstructural characterization techniques applied to the waste material in question has been instrumental in enhancing its utilization and compliance with current specifications.

Carbon sources examined include local molasses (M1), Thai molasses (M2), Taiwan sugar agricultural molasses (M3), and Taiwan sugar edible molasses (M4). Nitrogen sources considered are corn steep liquor (CSL), acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA), and enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE). Significant findings: Our findings reveal that M2CSL, a combination of Thai molasses and corn steep liquor, serves as a cost-effective and efficient medium for ABE fermentation, resulting in a butanol concentration of 7.4 ± 3.5 g/L. Furthermore, our research identifies variations in molasses and their impact on sucrose consumption inhibition. Notably, this study underscores the potential of insect peptone derived from enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE) as an alternative nitrogen source, while cautioning against the use of insect peptone obtained from acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA) due to its inhibitory properties.

Our method involves hydrogenolysis using specially designed Ru/CeO2 catalysts, which efficiently convert polyethylene into alkanes while keeping methane selectivity below 5 %. This optimization ensures maximum feed availability for subsequent microbial processes. Notably, the produced chemical intermediates are directly utilized in the biological phase, eliminating the need for intermediate processing. Gordonia sp. JW21, selected for its exceptional alkane degradation capabilities, efficiently metabolizes a wide range of alkane structures, including extended alkyl chains.

The study addressed the economic impact of conventional drying methods and explored the economic implications of purification strategies to separate the extract from the eutectic solvent. This was exemplified by employing solid-phase extraction (SPE) with C18-based adsorbent material. An alternative low-energy demanding approach using SiO2 particles was also assessed for profitability as a freeze-drying replacement strategy. The results highlighted challenges in the economic feasibility of eutectic solvent reusability when conventional SPE is applied, highlighting the need to obtain new and inexpensive bio-based adsorbents. Moreover, it was uncovered that the SiO2-based drying strategy presents itself as a financially viable alternative, effectively addressing the elevated energy requirements associated with conventional drying methods. The findings highlight the potential of alternative solvents-based processes, particularly towards challenges related to the circularity of raw materials. 2024 Elsevier B.V."

This study investigates the production of hydrogen (H2) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) by R. rubrum from syngas under photoheterotrophic conditions. An adaptive laboratory evolution strategy (ALE) has been carried out to improve the yield of the process. After 200 generations, two evolved strains were selected that showed reduced lag phase and enhanced poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and H2 synthesis compared to the parental strain. Genomic analysis of the photo-adapted (PA) variants showed four genes with single point mutations, including the photosynthesis gene expression regulator PpsR. The proteome of the variants suggested that the adapted variants overproduced H2 due to a more efficient CO oxidation through the CO-dehydrogenase enzyme complex and confirmed that energy acquisition was enhanced through overexpression of the photosynthetic system and metal cofactors essential for pigment biosynthesis. © 2024 The Author(s)"

text = "Peri-urban environments are significant reservoirs of wastewater, and releasing this untreated wastewater from these resources poses severe environmental and ecological threats. Wastewater mitigation through sustainable approaches is an emerging area of interest. Algae offers a promising strategy for carbon-neutral valorization and recycling of urban wastewater. Aiming to provide a proof-of-concept for complete valorization and recycling of urban wastewater in a peri-urban environment in a closed loop system, a newly isolated biocrust-forming cyanobacterium Desertifilum tharense BERC-3 was evaluated. Here, the highest growth and lipids productivity were achieved in urban wastewater compared to BG11 and synthetic wastewater. D. tharense BERC-3 showed 60–95% resource recovery efficiency and decreased total dissolved solids, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus contents of the water by 60.37%, 81.11%, 82.75%, 87.91%, 85.13%, 85.41%, 95.87%, respectively, making it fit for agriculture as per WHO's safety limits. Soil supplementation with 2% wastewater-cultivated algae as a soil amender, along with its irrigation with post-treated wastewater, improved the nitrogen content and microbial activity of the soil by 0.3–2.0-fold and 0.5-fold, respectively. Besides, the availability of phosphorus was also improved by 1.66-fold. The complete bioprocessing pipeline offered a complete biomass utilization. This study demonstrated the first proof-of-concept of integrating resource recovery and resource recycling using cyanobacteria to develop a peri-urban algae farming system. This can lead to establishing wastewater-driven algae cultivation systems as novel enterprises for rural migrants moving to urban areas. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

text = "The increasing global waste generated by industrial activities poses significant environmental challenges. Eco-waste management emerges as an economically viable solution for converting, valorizing, and repurposing these byproducts, aligning with circular economy principles, and aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Construction, known for its unsustainability due to high energy consumption, non-renewable resource utilization, waste generation, and greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from cement production, has led to the exploration of alternative materials. Magnesium oxide (MgO)-based cement, an alternative to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), has gained attention, leveraging Brazil's prominence as a major magnesite producer. This study explores the valorization of waste from kraft pulp mills of the paper industry, specifically lime sludge (LS) and lime slaker grits (grits), to produce magnesium oxysulfate (MOS)-based fiber cement boards. The effect of accelerated carbonation on cementitious composites produced with formulations containing grits and LS was investigated. Replacing 25% of the limestone with grits showed no noticeable differences in the properties of the boards, and MOR values close to 11.17 MPa were obtained. However, the physical-mechanical performance showed a decrease with the use of LS and higher concentrations of grits, associated with Na2SO4.XH2O formation in the system and ITZ structure formed around the aggregated particle, respectively. Carbonation in a saturated atmosphere led to the carbonation of the 5–1–7 phase, which was related to the decrease in mechanical strength of the boards after the curing process. The thermal decomposition of the Hydrated Magnesium Carbonates (HMCs) formed during accelerated carbonation corroborated with the changes in the physical properties of the composites, demonstrating that the carbonation products are formed within the voids and pores of the material and contribute to the reduction in water absorption of the boards.
