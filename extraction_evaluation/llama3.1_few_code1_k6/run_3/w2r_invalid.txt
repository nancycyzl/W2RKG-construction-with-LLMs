Furthermore, this model has been utilized to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) prediction model. Process sustainability analysis demonstrated an energy efficiency of 64 % while economic viability up to 80 % process efficiency with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 6 % and a payback period of 2107 days. An optimization strategy and an artificial neural network (ANN)-based predictive model have been developed. Optimization results revealed that a gasifier temperature of around 600 °C, a gasifying agent ratio of 2.0, and an acetaldehyde reactor temperature of 300 °C yield better process outcomes and revenue. The ANN model exhibited robust performance with coefficient of determination (R2) values ranging from 0.92 to 0.98 for acetaldehyde, hydrogen, and total revenue. Mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) fell within the range of 0.03–0.1 and 0.1–1.12 %, respectively. Consequently, given the favorable sustainability and predictive model performance, this study can be used for similar endeavors.

Biofuel production using agricultural waste materials as a source of energy sustainability is an important and promising approach to address both energy and environmental challenges. This process involves converting various types of agricultural residues and by-products into biofuels, which can be used as renewable and cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels 
This study focuses on different pre-treatment procedures, biofuel production, and agricultural waste materials as a biomass source of biofuel production, feedstocks, and technology conversion, the combination of thermochemical and biochemical conversion methods in biorefineries can enhance productivity, reduce waste, and increase resource use, while reducing environmental impact and energy consumption. 
This study investigates some of the difficulties associated with agricultural waste materials are diverse and can include crop residues (such as straw, husks, and shells), animal manure, food processing waste, forestry residues, and more. Researchers and companies are actively working to improve the efficiency and viability of agricultural waste-to-biofuel processes. 
The study suggests that incorporating agricultural waste valorization, such as biochar as a soil amendment, can enhance the sustainability of biofuel production. This approach can mitigate climate change and promote sustainable agriculture. The circular economy strategy can minimize waste byproducts. 
The study also suggests that governmental interventions can support sustainable practices and prioritize renewable energy sources. The study revealed that biofuel production from microalgae and energy crops is the most profitable and effective method, with commercial-scale production potential due to genetic engineering advancements. However, large-scale production remains challenging, necessitating new technologies to boost biofuel production and meet energy needs.

text = "The current study aims to model and optimize the catalytic pyrolysis of face masks incorporating a waste-derived catalyst to analyze the effect of process parameters (temperature, feed-to-catalyst ratio, and inert gas flow rate) on the oil yield of the process. An integrated approach of response surface methodology (R2-0.95) and machine learning (decision trees regression, R2-0.83) demonstrated a higher prediction accuracy and lower error margins. Explainable artificial intelligence tools spotlighted temperature to be the predominant parameter followed by feed-to-catalyst ratio. Experimental oil yield (13.5%) obtained at optimized parameters (516 °C temperature, 3:1 feed-to-catalyst ratio, and 163 mL/min inert gas flow rate) was compared with those predicted through response surface methodology (13.7%) and decision trees regression (13.12%), showcasing an absolute error range of 0.2–0.4 wt%. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of oil highlighted the presence of silica compounds that can be extracted as value-added chemicals. Further, the overall percentage of naphthene's, paraffins, and olefins in the oil were approximated to be around 40.5% based on the peak area. The presence of hydrocarbons in oil having carbon numbers predominantly in the range of gasoline and diesel as well as a high heating value of 36.56 MJ/kg demonstrated its potential to be used as a fuel. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of valorizing the face mask into energy-dense oil comparable to commercial range fuel using a spent adsorbent based catalyst. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Agriculture and industries related to the agriculture sector generate a large amount of waste each year. 
These wastes are usually burned or dumped, causing damage to the environment, the economy and society. 
Due to their composition, they have great potential for obtaining high value-added products in biorefineries. 
This fact, added to the growing demand for energy and chemicals from fossil resources, is driving the interest of the scientific community in them. 
Biorefinery processes are hardly profitable when applied individually, so a better alternative is to develop integrated multi-feedstock and multi-product biorefinery schemes using all biomass fractions in a zero-waste approach. 
However, for industrial scale application, extensive research, scale-up studies, and techno-economic and environmental feasibility analyses are needed. 
This review compiles information on integrated multi-biorefinery processes from agro-industrial wastes to shed light on the path towards sustainable development and circular bioeconomy.

The study addressed the economic impact of conventional drying methods and explored the economic implications of purification strategies to separate the extract from the eutectic solvent. This was exemplified by employing solid-phase extraction (SPE) with C18-based adsorbent material. An alternative low-energy demanding approach using SiO2 particles was also assessed for profitability as a freeze-drying replacement strategy. The results highlighted challenges in the economic feasibility of eutectic solvent reusability when conventional SPE is applied, highlighting the need to obtain new and inexpensive bio-based adsorbents. Moreover, it was uncovered that the SiO2-based drying strategy presents itself as a financially viable alternative, effectively addressing the elevated energy requirements associated with conventional drying methods. The findings highlight the potential of alternative solvents-based processes, particularly towards challenges related to the circularity of raw materials. 2024 Elsevier B.V."

This study investigates the production of hydrogen (H2) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) by R. rubrum from syngas under photoheterotrophic conditions. An adaptive laboratory evolution strategy (ALE) has been carried out to improve the yield of the process. After 200 generations, two evolved strains were selected that showed reduced lag phase and enhanced poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and H2 synthesis compared to the parental strain. Genomic analysis of the photo-adapted (PA) variants showed four genes with single point mutations, including the photosynthesis gene expression regulator PpsR. The proteome of the variants suggested that the adapted variants overproduced H2 due to a more efficient CO oxidation through the CO-dehydrogenase enzyme complex and confirmed that energy acquisition was enhanced through overexpression of the photosynthetic system and metal cofactors essential for pigment biosynthesis. © 2024 The Author(s)"

However, during handling, cooking, and storage these oils are susceptible to oxidation, resulting in the loss of nutritional value, the development of undesirable flavors, the production of harmful compounds, and a reduction in shelf life. To counteract oxidation and enhance oil stability, synthetic antioxidants have traditionally been employed. However, in recent times, consumer awareness has led to an increased preference for natural antioxidants because of the harmful effects of synthetic antioxidants on human health. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent research focused on the oxidative stability of various edible vegetable oils through the incorporation of natural antioxidants derived from fruits and vegetable waste. These antioxidants obtained from waste through diverse techniques are blended with different vegetable oils in the form of free extracts, encapsulated extracts, nano-encapsulated extracts, and nano-emulsion oil extracts to assess their antioxidant efficacy. These antioxidant-rich waste extracts efficiently prevented oxidation by scavenging free radicals, chelating metal ions, and delaying the formation of peroxides, offering a safer and more effective alternative to synthetic counterparts. Beyond their antioxidative properties, these extracts contribute to the nutritional enhancement of oils, functioning as nutraceuticals. This approach not only offers a natural means to protect edible oils but also facilitates efficient waste valorization, mitigating potential environmental impacts and making it a sustainable and eco-friendly strategy. 2024 The Authors"

Thermal hydrolyzed sludge (THS) exhibits considerable promise in generating medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) through chain elongation (CE) technology. This study developed a novel continuous CE process using THS as the substrate, achieving an optimal ethanol loading rate (5.8 g COD/L/d) and stable MCFA production at 10.9 g COD/L, with a rate of 3.6 g COD/L/d. The MCFAs primarily comprised n-caproate and n-caprylate, representing 41.5 % and 54.3 % of the total MCFAs, respectively. Utilization efficiencies for ethanol and acetate were nearly complete at 100 % and 92.8 %, respectively. Key microbial taxa identified under these optimal conditions included Alcaligenes, SRB2, Sporanaerobacter, and Kurthia, which were instrumental in critical pathways such as the generation of acetyl-CoA, the initial carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, the fatty acid biosynthesis cycle, and energy metabolism. This research provides a theoretical and technical blueprint for converting waste sludge into valuable MCFAs, promoting sustainable waste-to-resource strategies.
