Background: Valorizing waste residues is crucial to reaching sustainable development goals and shifting from a linear fossil-based economy to a circular economy. Fungal cell factories, due to their versatility and robustness, are instrumental in driving the bio-transformation of waste residues. The present work isolated a potent strain, i.e., Aspergillus fumigatus (ZS_AF), from an ancient Złoty Stok gold mine, which showcased distinctive capabilities for efficient hydrolytic enzyme production from lignocellulosic wastes. Results: The present study optimized hydrolytic enzyme production (cellulases, xylanases, and β-glucosidases) from pine sawdust (PSD) via solid-state fermentation using Aspergillus fumigatus (ZS_AF). The optimization, using response surface methodology (RSM), produced a twofold increase with maximal yields of 119.41 IU/gds for CMCase, 1232.23 IU/gds for xylanase, 63.19 IU/gds for β-glucosidase, and 31.08 IU/gds for FPase. The secretome profiling validated the pivotal role of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and auxiliary enzymes in biomass valorization. A total of 77% of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were constituted by glycoside hydrolases (66%), carbohydrate esterases (9%), auxiliary activities (3%), and polysaccharide lyases (3%). The saccharification of pretreated wheat straw and PSD generated high reducing sugar yields of 675.36 mg/g and 410.15 mg/g, respectively. Conclusion: These findings highlight the significance of an efficient, synergistic, and cost-effective arsenal of fungal enzymes for lignocellulosic waste valorization and their potential to contribute to waste-to-wealth creation through solid-waste management. The utilization of Aspergillus fumigatus (ZS_AF) from an unconventional origin and optimization strategies embodies an innovative approach that holds the potential to propel current waste valorization methods forward, directing the paradigm toward improved efficiency and sustainability.

The strain showed great biodegradation potential under batch shake flask and stirred tank reactor. Bacterial growth was considerably inhibited at initial BPA concentrations > 50 mg/L. Further, membrane bioreactor (MBR) for BPA biodegradation was also evaluated under different inlet BPA concentration and hydraulic retention time (HRT) and the maximum BPA removal efficiency of 94.4 % was attained with an influent BPA concentration of 25 mg/L at 5 d of HRT. MBR also showed better performance under shock loading conditions. Identification of BPA biodegraded pathways was also performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, elucidating the different metabolites and end products formed. A subsequent enhancement in BPA removal efficieny was also observed owing to the microfiltration system of MBR that was applied to separate bacterial biomass from effluent. The maximum removal efficiency was further enhanced to 98.5 % under the same operational schedule. As the strain has the ability to produce extracellular diol synthase enzyme which transforms oleic acid into the biopolyol 7,10-dihydroxy-8(E)-octadecenoic acid, the effluent containing the enzymes was supplemented with 1 % (v/v) oleic acid under whole cell and cell-free approaches. Cell-free technique showed an enhanced bioconversion efficiency in comparison to the traditional whole cell approach. Further, the produced biopolyol was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analyses and also depicted the antibacterial activity.

However, the scaling up of MAP of biomass and waste poses challenges, with investigations ongoing to uncover not only the technological aspect, but also both the environmental impacts and economic feasibility associated with this process/technology. The possible environmental impacts associated with MAP processes can be analyzed through systematic life-cycle assessment (LCA), while the economic feasibility can be evaluated via techno-economic analysis (TEA). This paper presents an overview of the current research trend in MAP and the products produced, as well as the LCA and TEA of the pyrolysis technologies. The LCA study reported a 2.5 folds reduction in energy consumption and up to 62% reduction in global warming potential. TEA study revealed that conventional pyrolysis has a greater profit for long-term assessment due to a higher maturity and less complexity technology; however, MAP may be more economically feasible in the future owing to the increased maturity and more established technology. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives for LCA and TEA in MAP are elucidated. 2024 Elsevier B.V."

The production of chemicals/products so far relies on fossil-based resources with the creation of several environmental problems at the global level. In this situation, a sustainable and circular economy model is necessitated to mitigate global environmental issues. Production of biowaste from various processing industries also creates environmental issues which would be valorized for the production of industrially important reactive and bioactive compounds.

Lignin acts as a vital part in biowaste composition which can be converted into a wide range of phenolic compounds. The phenolic compounds have attracted much attention, owing to their influence on diverse not only organoleptic parameters, such as taste or color, but also active agents for active packaging systems.

Crop residues of varied groups, which are an affluent source of lignocellulosic biomass could serve as a renewable resource for the biosynthesis of ferulic acid (FA). FA is obtained by the FA esterase enzyme action, and it can be further converted into various tail end phenolic flavor green compounds like vanillin, vanillic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid.

Lignin being renewable in nature, processing and management of biowastes towards sustainability is the need as far as the global industrial point is concerned. This review explores all the approaches for conversion of lignin into value-added phenolic compounds that could be included to packaging applications. These valorized products can exhibit the antioxidant, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, and due to these features can emerge to incorporate them into production of functional foods and be utilization of them at active food packaging application.

Polyethylene, as the predominant polymer produced globally, poses significant environmental challenges due to its resistance to natural decomposition. In this study, we introduce an innovative chemical[sbnd]biological approach for transforming waste polyethylene into valuable biosurfactants. Our method involves hydrogenolysis using specially designed Ru/CeO2 catalysts, which efficiently convert polyethylene into alkanes while keeping methane selectivity below 5 %. This optimization ensures maximum feed availability for subsequent microbial processes. Notably, the produced chemical intermediates are directly utilized in the biological phase, eliminating the need for intermediate processing. Gordonia sp. JW21, selected for its exceptional alkane degradation capabilities, efficiently metabolizes a wide range of alkane structures, including extended alkyl chains. The microbial process culminates in the generation of high-value biosurfactants. This synergistic strategy not only offers an effective solution for polyethylene waste management but also sets a precedent for the sustainable production of biosurfactants.

Fortunately, pyrolysis technology for HSW is emerging as a promising direction for achieving waste-to-resource conversion. To further mitigate secondary pollution, thermal activated-acid modified kaolin (H-kaolin) and thermal activated-alkali modified kaolin (OH-kaolin) were separately prepared, and their enhanced effects of immobilization and stabilization on heavy metals during pyrolysis were contrastively explored. Characterization results demonstrated that dehydroxy-dealuminization and zeolite NaA formation were intrinsic reasons for improvements in physical properties (specific surface area, pore volume) of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin, respectively. Experimental results revealed that H-kaolin outperformed OH-kaolin, showcasing its potential as a high-performance in-furnace adsorbent. Compared with other natural mineral-based sorbents reported in the literature, H-kaolin exhibited leading levels of immobilization, stabilization, and adsorption efficiency for heavy metals. Theoretical calculations illustrated that AlIII-O generated via dealuminization and SiIII-O in zeolite NaA were the main adsorption sites of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin, respectively, correspondingly binding with heavy metals to form oxides and silicates. The differences in active sites, electron transfer directions and bonding types during adsorption of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin were the intrinsic reasons for their distinct adsorption efficiency. Furthermore, derived chars with H-kaolin were deemed safe for application in pollutant adsorption in industrial field and soil improvement in gardens or parks. This research presented new ideas for developing high-performance in-furnace sorbents during pyrolysis, and explored the feasible safety application fields for pyrolytic derived-char.

This technical study investigates the sustainable utilization of municipal solid waste incinerated fly ash (MSWIFA) as a substitute for M-sand in construction materials. This study primarily focuses on reducing landfill waste and promoting waste reuse in the construction sector. This study evaluates various thermo-physical properties of MSWIFA-based concrete, including solar reflectance index, slip and skid resistance, straightness, flatness, rectangularity, water absorption, wet transfer, and thermal performance metrics such as heat flow values for thermal comfort and solar emissivity. The proposed concrete tiles have suitable thermal emissivity (0.87), solar reflectance (0.8), and solar absorption (0.26), which are appropriate for eco-friendly building techniques. The use of MSWIFA tiles lowered the indoor temperature by 2 °C when compared to conventional roof tiles at similar ambient conditions. MSWIFA-based concrete roof tiles are promising in terms of thermal comfort, energy efficiency, environmental conservation and waste reduction and promote a more sustainable approach in the construction industry. This research emphasizes the potential of waste-to-resource strategies in achieving sustainable development goals and reducing the ecological footprint of construction materials. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Wastewater mitigation through sustainable approaches is an emerging area of interest. Algae offers a promising strategy for carbon-neutral valorization and recycling of urban wastewater. Aiming to provide a proof-of-concept for complete valorization and recycling of urban wastewater in a peri-urban environment in a closed loop system, a newly isolated biocrust-forming cyanobacterium Desertifilum tharense BERC-3 was evaluated. Here, the highest growth and lipids productivity were achieved in urban wastewater compared to BG11 and synthetic wastewater. D. tharense BERC-3 showed 60–95% resource recovery efficiency and decreased total dissolved solids, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus contents of the water by 60.37%, 81.11%, 82.75%, 87.91%, 85.13%, 85.41%, 95.87%, respectively, making it fit for agriculture as per WHO's safety limits. Soil supplementation with 2% wastewater-cultivated algae as a soil amender, along with its irrigation with post-treated wastewater, improved the nitrogen content and microbial activity of the soil by 0.3–2.0-fold and 0.5-fold, respectively. Besides, the availability of phosphorus was also improved by 1.66-fold. The complete bioprocessing pipeline offered a complete biomass utilization. This study demonstrated the first proof-of-concept of integrating resource recovery and resource recycling using cyanobacteria to develop a peri-urban algae farming system. This can lead to establishing wastewater-driven algae cultivation systems as novel enterprises for rural migrants moving to urban areas.

Landfill mining is a promising solution to reclaim these sites along with the recovery of resources (materials and energy). During landfill mining operations, the combustible fraction is one of the major components recovered and needs proper management for maximizing resource recovery. For the identification of appropriate resource recovery options, knowledge of the physicochemical characteristics is required. The present study aims to assess the depth-wise change in the composition of legacy waste and the physicochemical characteristics of the combustible fraction. Furthermore, a material flow analysis considering the incineration of combustible fraction was performed to estimate the energy generation potential and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results of the compositional analysis of dry legacy waste revealed that the fine fraction (<4 mm soil-like material) was dominating with a share of 36%. The depth-wise analysis showed a decrease in the calorific value with increasing landfill depth, while no specific trend was observed for the other parameters analyzed, including proximate and ultimate analysis, and chlorine content. The material flow analysis performed for 100 tonnes of wet legacy waste indicated that 52 tonnes of waste is combustible fraction. The GHG emissions through incineration of one tonne of dry combustible fraction would be 1389 kg CO2-eq, with 1125 kWh of electrical energy generation potential. © 2024 Elsevier Inc."
