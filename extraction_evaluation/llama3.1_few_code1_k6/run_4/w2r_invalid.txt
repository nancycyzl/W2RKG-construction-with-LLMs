The upcycling of biomass waste gasification process for ethanol and acetaldehyde production has been augmented by integrating secondary and tertiary processes.
A simulation model using Aspen Plus, developed from experimental investigations to assess the viability of this proposed system.
Furthermore, this model has been utilized to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) prediction model.
Process sustainability analysis demonstrated an energy efficiency of 64 % while economic viability up to 80 % process efficiency with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 6 % and a payback period of 2107 days.
An optimization strategy and an artificial neural network (ANN)-based predictive model have been developed.
Optimization results revealed that a gasifier temperature of around 600 °C, a gasifying agent ratio of 2.0, and an acetaldehyde reactor temperature of 300 °C yield better process outcomes and revenue.
The ANN model exhibited robust performance with coefficient of determination (R2) values ranging from 0.92 to 0.98 for acetaldehyde, hydrogen, and total revenue.
Mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) fell within the range of 0.03–0.1 and 0.1–1.12 %, respectively.
Consequently, given the favorable sustainability and predictive model performance, this study can be used for similar endeavors.

The hydrothermal process reduced the nitrogen content in solid digestate by 49.10 %–81.79 %, thus reducing the NOX precursors in syngas and the N-containing substances in bio-oil. Additionally, the specific surface area and the total pore volume of biochar were enhanced from 25 m2/g to 60–73 m2/g and 0.06 cm3/g to 0.12–0.14 cm3/g, respectively. More defects, oxygen-containing functional groups, and doped Ca on the biochar resulted in a high phosphate removal efficiency of 94 %.

For this purpose, an UV conversion method for transforming the 7-dehydrocholesterol, highly present in fish, in vitamin D3 has been optimized. The UV wavelength, exposure time, temperature, stirring, and UV intensity were optimized using a surface response design tool. The optimized treatment was applied to five fish species with different fat percentages and the results were very promising reaching vitamin D3 levels >10 times higher than the pre-treatment ones.

The objective of this study is to find optimum conditions to valorize chestnut shell bioactive compounds with coloring pigments through microwave-assisted extraction.

Microwave power (800 W), extraction time (12 min) and solvent concentration (NaOH: 0.115 mol/L) were determined as the optimum conditions to maximize the responses like color value, total phenolic content and total antioxidant capacity.

In the optimized extract (OE), characterization of brown melanin like pigments were assessed by Spectrophotometer, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer and major phenolics were identified as; gallic acid, ellagic acid, protocatechuic acid, catechin, and epicatechin as 0.53, 0.48, 0.46, 0.46, 0.14 mg/g dried weight (dw) by High Performance Liquid Chromatography, respectively.

text = "Polyethylene, as the predominant polymer produced globally, poses significant environmental challenges due to its resistance to natural decomposition. In this study, we introduce an innovative chemical[sbnd]biological approach for transforming waste polyethylene into valuable biosurfactants. Our method involves hydrogenolysis using specially designed Ru/CeO2 catalysts, which efficiently convert polyethylene into alkanes while keeping methane selectivity below 5 %. This optimization ensures maximum feed availability for subsequent microbial processes. Notably, the produced chemical intermediates are directly utilized in the biological phase, eliminating the need for intermediate processing. Gordonia sp. JW21, selected for its exceptional alkane degradation capabilities, efficiently metabolizes a wide range of alkane structures, including extended alkyl chains. The microbial process culminates in the generation of high-value biosurfactants. This synergistic strategy not only offers an effective solution for polyethylene waste management but also sets a precedent for the sustainable production of biosurfactants. 2024 The Authors"

Here's how you can extract `waste`, `transforming_process`, and `transformed_resource` from the text:

```python
w2r = {"waste": [], "transforming_process": [], "transformed_resource": []}

# ... (rest of your code)

text = "Short-chain organic acids (SCFAs) are widely used in the chemical and food industries. However, their conventional production relies heavily on fossil raw materials, necessitating sustainable alternatives. Waste activated sludge (WAS) can serve as a renewable feedstock for SCFA production through oxidative hydrothermal pretreatment. Thus, the aim of this work was to optimize the production and recovery of SCFAs from partially oxidised WAS."

w2r["waste"].append("Waste activated sludge (WAS)")

transforming_process = [
    "oxidative hydrothermal pretreatment",
    "wet oxidation (WO)",
    "ultrafiltered using ceramic membranes",
]

w2r["transforming_process"] = transforming_process

transformed_resource = ["SCFAs", "acetic acid"]

w2r["transformed_resource"].append("SCFAs")
w2r["transformed_resource"].extend(transformed_resource)

print(w2r)
```

This code will output:

```python
{
    'waste': ['Waste activated sludge (WAS)'], 
    'transforming_process': [
        'oxidative hydrothermal pretreatment',
        'wet oxidation (WO)',

# Extract transforming processes
pattern_transforming_process = r"anaerobic digestion|AD|\bco-digestion\b"

for match in matches:
    transformed_resources.append(match[0])

print(waste)
print(transforming_processes)
print(transformed_resources)
