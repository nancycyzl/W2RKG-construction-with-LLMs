The pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis characteristics of large abundant bio-wastes, namely date pits (DP), peanut shells (PS), coffee grounds (CG), and tea waste (TW) were investigated in detail. The TG/DTG and pyrolysis procedures were used to examine the thermal pyrolysis behavior of these agro-wastes and their blends (50%CG/50%DP, 50%CG/50%PS, 50%DP/50%PS, 50%TW/50% DP,50%TW/50%PS and 50%CG/50% TW by weight). The characterization of these feedstock has shown their suitability for energy and material valorization. Experiments were carried out in a batch pyrolysis at a medium heating rate of 10 °C/min. The goal was to identify the best combination aiming to produce either char or hydrogen-rich gas, which can contribute to the development of the circular bio-economy. It was demonstrated that pyrolysis favored the liquid product, fluctuating from 34.31% (TW) to 50.92% (DP), while the co-pyrolysis greatly increased the gaseous product, which ranged between 42.02% (TW-DP) and 55.17% (PS-TW). The blending of CG and PS resulted in heightened reactivity, leading to an enhanced generation of H2 (34.44%). The optimal mixture was found to be CG-TW, showcasing superior performance in terms of gas quality (38.39% H2) and yield (53.74%). This outcome underscores the potential of CG and TW as a synergistic blend for efficient hydrogen-rich gas production. The FTIR findings revealed that the recovered biochars have the potential to serve as solid fuels, biofertilizers, or carbon materials. Additionally, they could be used as eco-friendly precursors for chemical and related industries. By analyzing various waste mixtures and their respective pyrolysis properties, this research aims to contribute to the development of sustainable waste management practices as well as efficient energy and material production methods.

text = "The upcycling of biomass waste gasification process for ethanol and acetaldehyde production has been augmented by integrating secondary and tertiary processes. A simulation model using Aspen Plus, developed from experimental investigations to assess the viability of this proposed system. Furthermore, this model has been utilized to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) prediction model. Process sustainability analysis demonstrated an energy efficiency of 64 % while economic viability up to 80 % process efficiency with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 6 % and a payback period of 2107 days. An optimization strategy and an artificial neural network (ANN)-based predictive model have been developed. Optimization results revealed that a gasifier temperature of around 600 °C, a gasifying agent ratio of 2.0, and an acetaldehyde reactor temperature of 300 °C yield better process outcomes and revenue. The ANN model exhibited robust performance with coefficient of determination (R2) values ranging from 0.92 to 0.98 for acetaldehyde, hydrogen, and total revenue. Mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) fell within the range of 0.03–0.1 and 0.1–1.12 %, respectively. Consequently, given the favorable sustainability and predictive model performance, this study can be used for similar endeavors. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This process involves converting various types of agricultural residues and by-products into biofuels, which can be used as renewable and cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels This study focuses on different pre-treatment procedures, biofuel production, and agricultural waste materials as a biomass source of biofuel production, feedstocks, and technology conversion, the combination of thermochemical and biochemical conversion methods in biorefineries can enhance productivity, reduce waste, and increase resource use, while reducing environmental impact and energy consumption. This study investigates some of the difficulties associated with agricultural waste materials are diverse and can include crop residues (such as straw, husks, and shells), animal manure, food processing waste, forestry residues, and more. Researchers and companies are actively working to improve the efficiency and viability of agricultural waste-to-biofuel processes. The study suggests that incorporating agricultural waste valorization, such as biochar as a soil amendment, can enhance the sustainability of biofuel production. This approach can mitigate climate change and promote sustainable agriculture. The circular economy strategy can minimize waste byproducts. The study also suggests that governmental interventions can support sustainable practices and prioritize renewable energy sources. The study revealed that biofuel production from microalgae and energy crops is the most profitable and effective method, with commercial-scale production potential due to genetic engineering advancements. However, large-scale production remains challenging, necessitating new technologies to boost biofuel production and meet energy needs.  "

The fish industry produces significant quantities of waste daily, with consequent high environmental impact. The aim of this work is to place a first brick for the fish waste reuse as a source of vitamin D3 extracts to be used for nutraceutical purposes. For this purpose, an UV conversion method for transforming the 7-dehydrocholesterol, highly present in fish, in vitamin D3 has been optimized. The UV wavelength, exposure time, temperature, stirring, and UV intensity were optimized using a surface response design tool. The optimized treatment was applied to five fish species with different fat percentages and the results were very promising reaching vitamin D3 levels >10 times higher than the pre-treatment ones.

The MI-Cl-FDU-12 anion-exchange adsorbent was synthesized via a facile one-pot synthesis approach using sodium silicate extracted from sorghum waste as a green silica source, 1-methyl-3-(triethoxysilylpropyl) imidazolium chloride as a functionalization agent, triblock copolymer F127 as a templating or pore-directing agent, trimethyl benzene as a swelling agent, KCl as an additive, and water as a solvent. The synthesis method offers a sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to the production of a so-called “green” adsorbent with a bimodal micro-/mesoporous structure and a high surface area comparable with the previous reports regarding FDU-12 synthesis. MI-Cl-FDU-12 was applied as an anion exchanger for the adsorption of toxic Cr(VI) oxyanions from aqueous media and various kinetic and isotherm models were fitted to experimental data to propose the adsorption behavior of Cr(VI) on the adsorbent. Langmuir model revealed the best fit to the experimental data at four different temperatures, indicating a homogeneous surface site affinity. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacities of the adsorbent were found to be 363.5, 385.5, 409.0, and 416.9 mg g−1 at 298, 303, 308, and 313 K, respectively; at optimal conditions (pH=2, adsorbent dose=3.0 mg, and contact time of 30 min), surpassing that of most previously reported Cr(VI) adsorbents in the literature. A regeneration study revealed that this adsorbent possesses outstanding performance even after six consecutive recycling. "

text = "The current study aims to model and optimize the catalytic pyrolysis of face masks incorporating a waste-derived catalyst to analyze the effect of process parameters (temperature, feed-to-catalyst ratio, and inert gas flow rate) on the oil yield of the process. An integrated approach of response surface methodology (R2-0.95) and machine learning (decision trees regression, R2-0.83) demonstrated a higher prediction accuracy and lower error margins. Explainable artificial intelligence tools spotlighted temperature to be the predominant parameter followed by feed-to-catalyst ratio. Experimental oil yield (13.5%) obtained at optimized parameters (516 °C temperature, 3:1 feed-to-catalyst ratio, and 163 mL/min inert gas flow rate) was compared with those predicted through response surface methodology (13.7%) and decision trees regression (13.12%), showcasing an absolute error range of 0.2–0.4 wt%. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of oil highlighted the presence of silica compounds that can be extracted as value-added chemicals. Further, the overall percentage of naphthene's, paraffins, and olefins in the oil were approximated to be around 40.5% based on the peak area. The presence of hydrocarbons in oil having carbon numbers predominantly in the range of gasoline and diesel as well as a high heating value of 36.56 MJ/kg demonstrated its potential to be used as a fuel. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of valorizing the face mask into energy-dense oil comparable to commercial range fuel using a spent adsorbent based catalyst. "

This study investigated the thermochemical processing of defatted residue to achieve zero-waste utilization of oil-bearing biomass using apricot seed as the model compound. Defatted apricot seeds (DAS) obtained after oil extraction from apricot seed were valorized through pyrolysis platform, focusing on enhancing sustainability using CO2 as the reaction medium. The results showed that CO2 plays a crucial role in the pyrolysis process, leading to an enhanced CO formation through homogeneous reaction between CO2 and volatile matters stemming from DAS. Specifically, CO2 oxidized volatile matters while simultaneously reducing to CO and influenced the morphological properties of DAS biochars (DASBs), leading the development of pores with sizes of less than 16 nm and exceeding 50 nm. The larger pore size of DASBs fabricated under N2 and CO2, compared to 2 nm (the molecular size of triglycerides), makes them suitable as porous materials for thermally induced transesterification. The presence of alkaline metals in DASBs expedited thermally induced transesterification. At ≤ 330 °C, DASB fabricated under CO2 condition exhibited faster reaction kinetics than under N2 condition. This suggests that the use of CO2 in the fabrication of DASB results in favorable surface properties conducive to the thermally induced transesterification of apricot oil.

Due to their composition, they have great potential for obtaining high value-added products in biorefineries. This fact, added to the growing demand for energy and chemicals from fossil resources, is driving the interest of the scientific community in them. Biorefinery processes are hardly profitable when applied individually, so a better alternative is to develop integrated multi-feedstock and multi-product biorefinery schemes using all biomass fractions in a zero-waste approach. However, for industrial scale application, extensive research, scale-up studies, and techno-economic and environmental feasibility analyses are needed.

Fortunately, pyrolysis technology for HSW is emerging as a promising direction for achieving waste-to-resource conversion. To further mitigate secondary pollution, thermal activated-acid modified kaolin (H-kaolin) and thermal activated-alkali modified kaolin (OH-kaolin) were separately prepared, and their enhanced effects of immobilization and stabilization on heavy metals during pyrolysis were contrastively explored. Characterization results demonstrated that dehydroxy-dealuminization and zeolite NaA formation were intrinsic reasons for improvements in physical properties (specific surface area, pore volume) of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin, respectively. Experimental results revealed that H-kaolin outperformed OH-kaolin, showcasing its potential as a high-performance in-furnace adsorbent. Compared with other natural mineral-based sorbents reported in the literature, H-kaolin exhibited leading levels of immobilization, stabilization, and adsorption efficiency for heavy metals. Theoretical calculations illustrated that AlIII-O generated via dealuminization and SiIII-O in zeolite NaA were the main adsorption sites of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin, respectively, correspondingly binding with heavy metals to form oxides and silicates. The differences in active sites, electron transfer directions and bonding types during adsorption of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin were the intrinsic reasons for their distinct adsorption efficiency. Furthermore, derived chars with H-kaolin were deemed safe for application in pollutant adsorption in industrial field and soil improvement in gardens or parks. This research presented new ideas for developing high-performance in-furnace sorbents during pyrolysis, and explored the feasible safety application fields for pyrolytic derived-char.

Iron (III) chloride (FeCl3) is a popular inorganic coagulant; although it has good performance in removing the turbidity (TB) in water at an alkaline medium, it cannot remove dissolved pollutants and natural organic matter such as humic acid water solution. Additionally, its hygroscopic nature complicates determining the optimal dosage for effective coagulation. Biochar (BC), a popular adsorbent with abundant functional groups, porous structure, and relatively high surface area, can adsorb adsorbates from water matrices. Therefore, combining BC with FeCl3 presents a potential solution to address the challenges associated with iron chloride. Consequently, this study focused on preparing and characterizing a novel biochar/ferric chloride-based coagulant (BC–FeCl3) for efficient removal of turbidity (TB) and natural organic matter, specifically humic acid (HA), from synthetic wastewater. The potential solution for the disposal of produced sludge was achieved by its recovering and recycling, then used in adsorption of HA from aqueous solution. The novel coagulant presented high TB and HA removal within 10 min of settling period at pH solution of 7.5. Furthermore, the recovered sludge presented a good performance in the adsorption of HA from aqueous solution. Adsorption isotherm and kinetics studies revealed that the Pseudo-second-order model best described kinetic adsorption, while the Freundlich model dominated the adsorption isotherm.

The presence of high concentrations of pollutants in effluents makes them an important source of environmental pollution. To solve this problem, various technologies have been developed for the treatment of industrial effluents. Currently, sustainable industrial production and the wastes reuse is of great importance for the economic development and environmental countries protection. This review initially proposes an introduction to sustainable industrial production, its foundations and aspects related to the circular economy and the process intensification. Current trends in waste reuse in Latin America are presented. In addition, the latest advances on the technologies used for effluents treatment are commented and discussed, considering the different sustainability indicators. The contributions reported in this manuscript demonstrated the efficiency of eliminating pollutants present in industrial effluents, reaching removal percentages of pollutants from 20 to 100 %. Finally, it is important to mention that the applied technologies are useful not only for the decontamination of an industrial effluent and the environmental care but also for the possibility of give an additional use to these resources considering the water shortage present in many parts of Latin America.

text = "Recycling aluminium in a rotary furnace with salt-fluxes allows recovering valuable alloys from hard-to-recycle waste/side-streams such as packaging, dross and incinerator bottom ash. However, this recycling route generates large amounts of salt-slag/salt-cake hazardous wastes which can pose critical environmental risks if landfilled. To tackle this issue, the metallurgical industry has developed processes to valorise the salt-slag residues into recyclable salts and aluminium concentrates, while producing by-products such as ammonium sulphate and non-metallic compounds (NMCs), with applications in the construction or chemical industries. This study aims to assess through LCA the environmental impacts of recycling aluminium in rotary furnaces for both salt-slag management routes: valorisation or landfill. It was found that this recycling process brings forth considerable net environmental profits, which increase for all the considered impact categories if the salt-slag is valorised. The main benefits arise from the production of secondary cast aluminium alloys, which is not unexpected due to the high energy intensity of aluminium primary production. However, the LCA results also identify other hotspots which play a significant role, and which should be considered for the optimisation of the process based on its environmental performance, such as the production of by-products, the consumption of energy/fuels and the avoidance of landfilling waste. Additionally, the assessment shows that the indicators for mineral resource scarcity, human carcinogenic toxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity are particularly benefited by the salt-slag valorisation. Finally, a sensitivity analysis illustrates the criticality of the metal yield assumptions when calculating the global warming potential of aluminium recycling routes. "
