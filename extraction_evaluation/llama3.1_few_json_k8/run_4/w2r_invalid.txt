Here's the result:

**Summary**

The study investigated the pyrolysis characteristics of various abundant bio-wastes (date pits, peanut shells, coffee grounds, and tea waste) and their blends. The results showed that blending certain combinations can enhance the production of either char or hydrogen-rich gas. The optimal mixture was found to be a blend of coffee grounds and tea waste, which produced high-quality gas with 38.39% hydrogen content. This blend also resulted in the highest yield of gas (53.74%). Additionally, the recovered biochars from pyrolysis had potential applications as solid fuels, biofertilizers, or carbon materials.

The research found that:

* The maximum tensile strength of FRCMs with 6 nonwoven fabric layers was 3.7 MPa.
* The toughness index of these composites was superior to 25 kJ/m2.
* The mean modulus of rupture was 11.6 MPa, and the fracture energy index was 4.3 kJ/m2.
* After dry-wet accelerated aging, the post-cracking performance of the developed composites decreased by approximately 40% in toughness and 11% in strength due to fiber embrittlement.
* Shredded fibers recovered from protective clothing showed improved mechanical properties after being immersed in a binary matrix.
* Replacing partially Portland Cement with silica fume (between 30-50%) was seen as a sustainable alternative to improve the performance of aged fibers by more than 10%.

The study explored the potential of metathetic degradation as a strategy to treat waste vulcanized emulsion-type butadiene-based rubbers, which were previously unaddressed due to their composition. The researchers used nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) gloves as a model and found that the process involved not only cross-metathesis but also ring-closing metathesis between adjacent cis-1,4-structure units. This discovery opens up possibilities for recycling waste vulcanized emulsion-type diene-based rubbers.

Here's a possible completion:

**Result:**

Our study demonstrates that ABE fermentation can be successfully carried out using various carbon and nitrogen sources. The combination of Thai molasses (M2) and corn steep liquor (CSL), denoted as M2CSL, emerges as an optimal medium for ABE fermentation, yielding a high butanol concentration of 7.4 ± 3.5 g/L. This finding is significant as it provides a cost-effective solution for the production of biobutanol.

Furthermore, our research highlights the importance of sucrose consumption inhibition in molasses-based media. The results show that certain types of molasses (M1 and M2) exhibit higher sucrose consumption rates compared to others (M3 and M4), indicating potential variations in fermentation performance.

Notably, the study also reveals the potential of enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE) as an alternative nitrogen source for ABE fermentation. The results suggest that IE-derived insect peptone can serve as a viable substitute for traditional nitrogen sources like corn steep liquor, offering new opportunities for sustainable biobutanol production.

Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the optimization of carbon and nitrogen sources for ABE fermentation, paving the way for improved biobutanol production and reduced costs.

The study found that:

* Replacing 25% of limestone with grits did not affect the properties of the fiber cement boards.
* The use of LS and higher concentrations of grits led to a decrease in physical-mechanical performance.
* Carbonation in a saturated atmosphere caused a decrease in mechanical strength of the boards after curing.
* Thermal decomposition of HMCs formed during accelerated carbonation contributed to changes in physical properties and reduction in water absorption of the boards.

Overall, the study suggests that the valorization of waste from kraft pulp mills (lime sludge and lime slaker grits) can be used to produce magnesium oxysulfate-based fiber cement boards with promising mechanical properties. However, further optimization is needed to improve their physical-mechanical performance.
