The study found that recycling aluminium in rotary furnaces with salt-fluxes has significant net environmental benefits, especially when the salt-slag is valorized rather than landfilled. This process generates recyclable salts and aluminium concentrates, as well as by-products like ammonium sulphate and non-metallic compounds (NMCs), which have various industrial applications.

 Key points:

1.  Recycling aluminium in rotary furnaces with salt-fluxes has significant environmental benefits.
2.  Valorising the salt-slag residues further increases these benefits.

5.  Salt-slag valorisation particularly benefits indicators such as mineral resource scarcity, human carcinogenic toxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity.
6.  Sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of metal yield assumptions in calculating global warming potential for aluminium recycling routes.

Overall, this study suggests that aluminium recycling in rotary furnaces with salt-fluxes is an environmentally beneficial process, especially when salt-slag valorisation is implemented.

* Reusing treated IBA is the most sustainable approach and remains effective up to a transportation distance of d + 15 km.
* Utilizing IBA with restrictions is recommended in cases where treatment is not feasible, up to a transportation distance of d + 5 km.

Overall, the study suggests that IBA can be a suitable replacement for natural aggregates in road construction, but its use requires proper treatment and management to minimize environmental impacts.
