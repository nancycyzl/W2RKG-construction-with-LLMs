It seems like you're providing a summary of a scientific study about biobutanol production through ABE fermentation. Here's a rewritten version in a more formal tone, with the requested format:

**Result**

The present study investigates various carbon and nitrogen sources for acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation to produce biobutanol. The findings indicate that Thai molasses (M2) combined with corn steep liquor (CSL), denoted as M2CSL, serves as a cost-effective and efficient medium for ABE fermentation. This combination resulted in a butanol concentration of 7.4 ± 3.5 g/L.

Furthermore, the study highlights the impact of molasses variations on sucrose consumption inhibition. Notably, enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE) was found to be a viable alternative nitrogen source for ABE fermentation. Conversely, acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA) exhibited inhibitory properties and is not recommended as a nitrogen source.

These results contribute to the understanding of biobutanol production through ABE fermentation and provide insights into optimizing the raw materials used in this process.

1. **Optimized conditions for SCFA production**: The best temperature for producing short-chain organic acids (SCFAs) through wet oxidation was found to be 160 °C.
2. **Pre-purification of SCFAs**: Membrane ultrafiltration with a total recycle mode achieved rejections of 39% for Total Organic Carbon (TOC), 73% for color, and only 4% for SCFAs, effectively pre-purifying the SCFAs in the waste activated sludge.
