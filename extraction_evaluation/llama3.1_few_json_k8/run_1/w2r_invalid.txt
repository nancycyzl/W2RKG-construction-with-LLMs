The study explored a new approach to recycling waste rubber using metathetic degradation, a method previously only applied to natural rubber due to its high cis-1,4- structure content. For the first time, this technique was successfully applied to vulcanized emulsion type butadiene-based rubbers, specifically nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), which is more widely used than natural rubber. The research found that metathetic degradation of NBR involved not only cross-metathesis between cis-1,4-structure and a chain transfer agent but also ring closing metathesis between adjacent cis-1,4- and 1,2- structures. This breakthrough is expected to pave the way for recycling all types of vulcanized emulsion type diene-based rubbers, significantly increasing their potential for reuse as resources rather than being discarded as waste.
