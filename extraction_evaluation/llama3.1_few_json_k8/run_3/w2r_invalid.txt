Here is a possible result paragraph based on the provided background and methods:

**Result:** This study demonstrates that the combination of Thai molasses (M2) and corn steep liquor (CSL), denoted as M2CSL, emerges as an optimal medium for ABE fermentation. The use of M2CSL resulted in a butanol concentration of 7.4 ± 3.5 g/L, which is comparable to other reported studies.

This study found that recycling aluminum in rotary furnaces can have a positive environmental impact, even considering the generation of salt-slag hazardous wastes. The valorisation process for salt-slag residues was found to be particularly beneficial, reducing the environmental impacts across various categories.
