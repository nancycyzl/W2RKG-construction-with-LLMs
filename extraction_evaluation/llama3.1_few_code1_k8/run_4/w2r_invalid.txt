text = "Advanced thermochemical technologies for plastic waste valorization represent an interesting alternative to waste-to-energy options. They are particularly appealing for waste-to-hydrogen and waste-to-chemicals applications, with autothermal steam-oxygen gasification in fluidized bed reactors showing the greatest market potential. The study describes a series of experimental tests carried out on a large pilot-scale fluidized bed gasifier, using steam and O2-enriched air, with increasing fractions of oxygen. Different values of the main operating parameters are varied: equivalence ratio (0.22–0.25), steam-to-carbon ratio (0.7–1.13), and steam-to-oxygen ratio (up to 3.2). The fuel consists of real mixed plastic waste coming from separate collection of municipal solid wastes. The data obtained are used to investigate in depth the role of the main operating parameters and to improve and validate a recently developed one-dimensional kinetic model for waste gasification. The validation shows a good agreement between experimental data and model results, suggesting the reliability of the model to predict the reactor behavior under conditions of pure steam-oxygen gasification, relevant to many industrial applications. It has been found that the equivalence ratio is the parameter that most affects the syngas composition. At a constant equivalent ratio, the molar fraction of oxygen in the enriched air shows a limited influence on syngas composition while the steam is crucial in controlling the temperature along the reactor. Provided that the steam-to-carbon molar ratio is larger than 1.5, steam affects mainly the reactor temperature rather than the syngas composition, qualifying the steam-to-oxygen molar ratio as an instrumental parameter for smooth plant operation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

text = "The upcycling of biomass waste gasification process for ethanol and acetaldehyde production has been augmented by integrating secondary and tertiary processes. A simulation model using Aspen Plus, developed from experimental investigations to assess the viability of this proposed system. Furthermore, this model has been utilized to create an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) prediction model. Process sustainability analysis demonstrated an energy efficiency of 64 % while economic viability up to 80 % process efficiency with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 6 % and a payback period of 2107 days. An optimization strategy and an artificial neural network (ANN)-based predictive model have been developed. Optimization results revealed that a gasifier temperature of around 600 °C, a gasifying agent ratio of 2.0, and an acetaldehyde reactor temperature of 300 °C yield better process outcomes and revenue. The ANN model exhibited robust performance with coefficient of determination (R2) values ranging from 0.92 to 0.98 for acetaldehyde, hydrogen, and total revenue. Mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) fell within the range of 0.03–0.1 and 0.1–1.12 %, respectively. Consequently, given the favorable sustainability and predictive model performance, this study can be used for similar endeavors. "

Microbial enzymes have emerged as key players in the degradation of polysaccharides, offering versatile applications in biotechnology and industry. Among these enzymes, glycoside hydrolases (GHs) play a central role. Xylanases, in particular, are used in a wide range of applications and are essential for the production of xylose, which can be fermented into bioethanol or find use in many other industries. Currently, fungal secretomes dominate as the main reservoir of lignocellulolytic enzymes, but thermophilic microorganisms offer notable advantages in terms of enzyme stability and production efficiency. Here we present the genomic characterization of Geobacillus stearothermophilus GF16 to identify genes encoding putative enzymes involved in lignocellulose degradation. Thermostable GHs secreted by G. stearothermophilus GF16 were investigated and found to be active on different natural polysaccharides and synthetic substrates, revealing an array of inducible GH activities. In particular, the concentrated secretome possesses significant thermostable xylanase and β-xylosidase activities (5 ×103 U/L and 1.7 ×105 U/L, respectively), highlighting its potential for application in biomass valorization. We assessed the hemicellulose hydrolysis capabilities of various agri-food wastes using the concentrated secretome of the strain cultivated on xylan. An impressive 300-fold increase in xylose release compared to a commercially available cocktail was obtained with the secretome, underscoring the remarkable efficacy of this approach.

text = "Background: Biobutanol, produced through acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, has been proposed for use as a transportation fuel and for the development of butanol-based materials. However, the economic viability of ABE fermentation is heavily dependent on the cost of raw materials. Methods: This study assesses various carbon and nitrogen sources for ABE fermentation. Carbon sources examined include local molasses (M1), Thai molasses (M2), Taiwan sugar agricultural molasses (M3), and Taiwan sugar edible molasses (M4). Nitrogen sources considered are corn steep liquor (CSL), acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA), and enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE). Significant findings: Our findings reveal that M2CSL, a combination of Thai molasses and corn steep liquor, serves as a cost-effective and efficient medium for ABE fermentation, resulting in a butanol concentration of 7.4 ± 3.5 g/L. Furthermore, our research identifies variations in molasses and their impact on sucrose consumption inhibition. Notably, this study underscores the potential of insect peptone derived from enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE) as an alternative nitrogen source, while cautioning against the use of insect peptone obtained from acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA) due to its inhibitory properties.

text = "The production of chemicals/products so far relies on fossil-based resources with the creation of several environmental problems at the global level. In this situation, a sustainable and circular economy model is necessitated to mitigate global environmental issues. Production of biowaste from various processing industries also creates environmental issues which would be valorized for the production of industrially important reactive and bioactive compounds. Lignin acts as a vital part in biowaste composition which can be converted into a wide range of phenolic compounds. The phenolic compounds have attracted much attention, owing to their influence on diverse not only organoleptic parameters, such as taste or color, but also active agents for active packaging systems. Crop residues of varied groups, which are an affluent source of lignocellulosic biomass could serve as a renewable resource for the biosynthesis of ferulic acid (FA). FA is obtained by the FA esterase enzyme action, and it can be further converted into various tail end phenolic flavor green compounds like vanillin, vanillic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid. Lignin being renewable in nature, processing and management of biowastes towards sustainability is the need as far as the global industrial point is concerned. This review explores all the approaches for conversion of lignin into value-added phenolic compounds that could be included to packaging applications. These valorized products can exhibit the antioxidant, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, and due to these features can emerge to incorporate them into production of functional foods and be utilization of them at active food packaging application. These approaches would be an important step for utilization of the recovered bioactive compounds at the nutraceutical and food industrial sectors. "

This study developed a novel continuous CE process using THS as the substrate, achieving an optimal ethanol loading rate (5.8 g COD/L/d) and stable MCFA production at 10.9 g COD/L, with a rate of 3.6 g COD/L/d. The MCFAs primarily comprised n-caproate and n-caprylate, representing 41.5 % and 54.3 % of the total MCFAs, respectively. Utilization efficiencies for ethanol and acetate were nearly complete at 100 % and 92.8 %, respectively. Key microbial taxa identified under these optimal conditions included Alcaligenes, SRB2, Sporanaerobacter, and Kurthia, which were instrumental in critical pathways such as the generation of acetyl-CoA, the initial carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, the fatty acid biosynthesis cycle, and energy metabolism. This research provides a theoretical and technical blueprint for converting waste sludge into valuable MCFAs, promoting sustainable waste-to-resource strategies. © 2024"

The presence of high concentrations of pollutants in effluents makes them an important source of environmental pollution. To solve this problem, various technologies have been developed for the treatment of industrial effluents. Currently, sustainable industrial production and the wastes reuse is of great importance for the economic development and environmental countries protection. This review initially proposes an introduction to sustainable industrial production, its foundations and aspects related to the circular economy and the process intensification. Current trends in waste reuse in Latin America are presented. In addition, the latest advances on the technologies used for effluents treatment are commented and discussed, considering the different sustainability indicators. The contributions reported in this manuscript demonstrated the efficiency of eliminating pollutants present in industrial effluents, reaching removal percentages of pollutants from 20 to 100 %. Finally, it is important to mention that the applied technologies are useful not only for the decontamination of an industrial effluent and the environmental care but also for the possibility of give an additional use to these resources considering the water shortage present in many parts of Latin America. The results show that water reuse can be a viable option."

text = "In India, majority of the generated municipal solid waste (MSW) was dumped in poorly managed landfills and dumpsites over the past decades and is an environmental and health hazard. Landfill mining is a promising solution to reclaim these sites along with the recovery of resources (materials and energy). During landfill mining operations, the combustible fraction is one of the major components recovered and needs proper management for maximizing resource recovery. For the identification of appropriate resource recovery options, knowledge of the physicochemical characteristics is required. The present study aims to assess the depth-wise change in the composition of legacy waste and the physicochemical characteristics of the combustible fraction. Furthermore, a material flow analysis considering the incineration of combustible fraction was performed to estimate the energy generation potential and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results of the compositional analysis of dry legacy waste revealed that the fine fraction (<4 mm soil-like material) was dominating with a share of 36%. The depth-wise analysis showed a decrease in the calorific value with increasing landfill depth, while no specific trend was observed for the other parameters analyzed, including proximate and ultimate analysis, and chlorine content. The material flow analysis performed for 100 tonnes of wet legacy waste indicated that 52 tonnes of waste is combustible fraction. The GHG emissions through incineration of one tonne of dry combustible fraction would be 1389 kg CO2-eq, with 1125 kWh of electrical energy generation potential. 36% fine fraction (<4 mm soil-like material). 52 tonnes combustible fraction."
