The TG/DTG and pyrolysis procedures were used to examine the thermal pyrolysis behavior of these agro-wastes and their blends (50%CG/50%DP, 50%CG/50%PS, 50%DP/50%PS, 50%TW/50% DP,50%TW/50%PS and 50%CG/50% TW by weight). The characterization of these feedstock has shown their suitability for energy and material valorization. Experiments were carried out in a batch pyrolysis at a medium heating rate of 10 °C/min. The goal was to identify the best combination aiming to produce either char or hydrogen-rich gas, which can contribute to the development of the circular bio-economy. It was demonstrated that pyrolysis favored the liquid product, fluctuating from 34.31% (TW) to 50.92% (DP), while the co-pyrolysis greatly increased the gaseous product, which ranged between 42.02% (TW-DP) and 55.17% (PS-TW). The blending of CG and PS resulted in heightened reactivity, leading to an enhanced generation of H2 (34.44%). The optimal mixture was found to be CG-TW, showcasing superior performance in terms of gas quality (38.39% H2) and yield (53.74%). This outcome underscores the potential of CG and TW as a synergistic blend for efficient hydrogen-rich gas production. The FTIR findings revealed that the recovered biochars have the potential to serve as solid fuels, biofertilizers, or carbon materials. Additionally, they could be used as eco-friendly precursors for chemical and related industries. By analyzing various waste mixtures and their respective pyrolysis properties, this research aims to contribute to the development of sustainable waste management practices as well as efficient energy and material production methods.

Background: Valorizing waste residues is crucial to reaching sustainable development goals and shifting from a linear fossil-based economy to a circular economy. Fungal cell factories, due to their versatility and robustness, are instrumental in driving the bio-transformation of waste residues. The present work isolated a potent strain, i.e., Aspergillus fumigatus (ZS_AF), from an ancient Złoty Stok gold mine, which showcased distinctive capabilities for efficient hydrolytic enzyme production from lignocellulosic wastes.

Results: The present study optimized hydrolytic enzyme production (cellulases, xylanases, and β-glucosidases) from pine sawdust (PSD) via solid-state fermentation using Aspergillus fumigatus (ZS_AF). The optimization, using response surface methodology (RSM), produced a twofold increase with maximal yields of 119.41 IU/gds for CMCase, 1232.23 IU/gds for xylanase, 63.19 IU/gds for β-glucosidase, and 31.08 IU/gds for FPase.

The secretome profiling validated the pivotal role of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and auxiliary enzymes in biomass valorization. A total of 77% of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were constituted by glycoside hydrolases (66%), carbohydrate esterases (9%), auxiliary activities (3%), and polysaccharide lyases (3%). The saccharification of pretreated wheat straw and PSD generated high reducing sugar yields of 675.36 mg/g and 410.15 mg/g, respectively.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the significance of an efficient, synergistic, and cost-effective arsenal of fungal enzymes for lignocellulosic waste valorization and their potential to contribute to waste-to-wealth creation through solid-waste management. The utilization of Aspergillus fumigatus (ZS_AF) from an unconventional origin and optimization strategies embodies an innovative approach that holds the potential to propel current waste valorization methods forward, directing the paradigm toward improved efficiency and sustainability.

However, the high NOX emissions during pyrolysis limit its application. This study proposed a hydrothermal coupled pyrolysis process to control the element transfer in digestate during biochar production. The efficient reduction of NOX emissions and the improvement of biochar adsorbability were realized. The hydrothermal process reduced the nitrogen content in solid digestate by 49.10 %–81.79 %, thus reducing the NOX precursors in syngas and the N-containing substances in bio-oil. Additionally, the specific surface area and the total pore volume of biochar were enhanced from 25 m2/g to 60–73 m2/g and 0.06 cm3/g to 0.12–0.14 cm3/g, respectively. More defects, oxygen-containing functional groups, and doped Ca on the biochar resulted in a high phosphate removal efficiency of 94 %. The proposed technology provides an efficient and environmentally friendly way to utilize the digestate. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This approach can mitigate climate change and promote sustainable agriculture. The circular economy strategy can minimize waste byproducts. The study also suggests that governmental interventions can support sustainable practices and prioritize renewable energy sources.

This study aims to technically support reduction of Portland cement consumption in the manufacture of nonstructural masonry units, generally known as hollow concrete blocks (HCBs), by replacing cement with waste products obtained from the chemical industry in Mexico. Consequently, mortars with fresh waste material from the warehouse that complied with compressive strength requirements of current standards were prepared with which the masonry units were manufactured. The HCBs exhibited low water absorption owing to lower porosity, and their thermal conductivity was slightly superior to that of the commercially available units. The compressive strengths of the walls manufactured with these masonry units indicated that they are suitable for commercial use. Finally, the novelty of this research focuses on the fact that the waste material used has a minimal pre-treatment to design mixtures for producing hollow concrete blocks (HCBs), intending to reduce the carbon footprint of the final product by cutting down on treatment conventional practices like drying, cleaning, and the need to use more Portland cement to increase the compressive strength of HCB.

MBR also showed better performance under shock loading conditions. Identification of BPA biodegraded pathways was also performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, elucidating the different metabolites and end products formed. A subsequent enhancement in BPA removal efficieny was also observed owing to the microfiltration system of MBR that was applied to separate bacterial biomass from effluent. The maximum removal efficiency was further enhanced to 98.5 % under the same operational schedule.

    text = "The mandated waste classification poses challenges for the eco-friendly disposal of combustible high-organic solid waste (HSW), characterized by elevated heavy metal content and a low ash proportion. Fortunately, pyrolysis technology for HSW is emerging as a promising direction for achieving waste-to-resource conversion. To further mitigate secondary pollution, thermal activated-acid modified kaolin (H-kaolin) and thermal activated-alkali modified kaolin (OH-kaolin) were separately prepared, and their enhanced effects of immobilization and stabilization on heavy metals during pyrolysis were contrastively explored. Characterization results demonstrated that dehydroxy-dealuminization and zeolite NaA formation were intrinsic reasons for improvements in physical properties (specific surface area, pore volume) of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin, respectively. Experimental results revealed that H-kaolin outperformed OH-kaolin, showcasing its potential as a high-performance in-furnace adsorbent. Compared with other natural mineral-based sorbents reported in the literature, H-kaolin exhibited leading levels of immobilization, stabilization, and adsorption efficiency for heavy metals. Theoretical calculations illustrated that AlIII-O generated via dealuminization and SiIII-O in zeolite NaA were the main adsorption sites of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin, respectively, correspondingly binding with heavy metals to form oxides and silicates. The differences in active sites, electron transfer directions and bonding types during adsorption of H-kaolin and OH-kaolin were the intrinsic reasons for their distinct adsorption efficiency. Furthermore, derived chars with H-kaolin were deemed safe for application in pollutant adsorption in industrial field and soil improvement in gardens or parks. This research presented new ideas for developing high-performance in-furnace sorbents during pyrolysis, and explored the feasible safety application fields for pyrolytic derived-char.

This study investigates the production of hydrogen (H2) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) by R. rubrum from syngas under photoheterotrophic conditions. An adaptive laboratory evolution strategy (ALE) has been carried out to improve the yield of the process. After 200 generations, two evolved strains were selected that showed reduced lag phase and enhanced poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and H2 synthesis compared to the parental strain. Genomic analysis of the photo-adapted (PA) variants showed four genes with single point mutations, including the photosynthesis gene expression regulator PpsR. The proteome of the variants suggested that the adapted variants overproduced H2 due to a more efficient CO oxidation through the CO-dehydrogenase enzyme complex and confirmed that energy acquisition was enhanced through overexpression of the photosynthetic system and metal cofactors essential for pigment biosynthesis.

However, during handling, cooking, and storage these oils are susceptible to oxidation, resulting in the loss of nutritional value, the development of undesirable flavors, the production of harmful compounds, and a reduction in shelf life. To counteract oxidation and enhance oil stability, synthetic antioxidants have traditionally been employed. However, in recent times, consumer awareness has led to an increased preference for natural antioxidants because of the harmful effects of synthetic antioxidants on human health. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent research focused on the oxidative stability of various edible vegetable oils through the incorporation of natural antioxidants derived from fruits and vegetable waste. These antioxidants obtained from waste through diverse techniques are blended with different vegetable oils in the form of free extracts, encapsulated extracts, nano-encapsulated extracts, and nano-emulsion oil extracts to assess their antioxidant efficacy. These antioxidant-rich waste extracts efficiently prevented oxidation by scavenging free radicals, chelating metal ions, and delaying the formation of peroxides, offering a safer and more effective alternative to synthetic counterparts. Beyond their antioxidative properties, these extracts contribute to the nutritional enhancement of oils, functioning as nutraceuticals. This approach not only offers a natural means to protect edible oils but also facilitates efficient waste valorization, mitigating potential environmental impacts and making it a sustainable and eco-friendly strategy.

text = "The deep removal of organic pollutants is challenging for coagulation technology in drinking water and wastewater treatment plants to satisfy the rising water standards. Iron (III) chloride (FeCl3) is a popular inorganic coagulant; although it has good performance in removing the turbidity (TB) in water at an alkaline medium, it cannot remove dissolved pollutants and natural organic matter such as humic acid water solution. Additionally, its hygroscopic nature complicates determining the optimal dosage for effective coagulation. Biochar (BC), a popular adsorbent with abundant functional groups, porous structure, and relatively high surface area, can adsorb adsorbates from water matrices. Therefore, combining BC with FeCl3 presents a potential solution to address the challenges associated with iron chloride. Consequently, this study focused on preparing and characterizing a novel biochar/ferric chloride-based coagulant (BC–FeCl3) for efficient removal of turbidity (TB) and natural organic matter, specifically humic acid (HA), from synthetic wastewater. The potential solution for the disposal of produced sludge was achieved by its recovering and recycling, then used in adsorption of HA from aqueous solution. The novel coagulant presented high TB and HA removal within 10 min of settling period at pH solution of 7.5. Furthermore, the recovered sludge presented a good performance in the adsorption of HA from aqueous solution. Adsorption isotherm and kinetics studies revealed that the Pseudo-second-order model best described kinetic adsorption, while the Freundlich model dominated the adsorption isotherm. "

Thermal hydrolyzed sludge (THS) exhibits considerable promise in generating medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) through chain elongation (CE) technology. This study developed a novel continuous CE process using THS as the substrate, achieving an optimal ethanol loading rate (5.8 g COD/L/d) and stable MCFA production at 10.9 g COD/L, with a rate of 3.6 g COD/L/d. The MCFAs primarily comprised n-caproate and n-caprylate, representing 41.5 % and 54.3 % of the total MCFAs, respectively. Utilization efficiencies for ethanol and acetate were nearly complete at 100 % and 92.8 %, respectively. Key microbial taxa identified under these optimal conditions included Alcaligenes, SRB2, Sporanaerobacter, and Kurthia, which were instrumental in critical pathways such as the generation of acetyl-CoA, the initial carboxylation of acetyl-CoA, the fatty acid biosynthesis cycle, and energy metabolism. This research provides a theoretical and technical blueprint for converting waste sludge into valuable MCFAs, promoting sustainable waste-to-resource strategies.
