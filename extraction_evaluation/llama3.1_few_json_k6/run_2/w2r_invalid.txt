Here is a rewritten version of the paragraph in a more formal and neutral tone:

Background:
Biobutanol, produced through acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, has been proposed as a potential transportation fuel and butanol-based material. However, the economic viability of ABE fermentation depends heavily on the cost of raw materials.

Methods:
This study evaluates various carbon and nitrogen sources for ABE fermentation to optimize production costs. The examined carbon sources include local molasses (M1), Thai molasses (M2), Taiwan sugar agricultural molasses (M3), and Taiwan sugar edible molasses (M4). Nitrogen sources considered are corn steep liquor (CSL), acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA), and enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE).

Results:
The study reveals that a combination of Thai molasses (M2) and corn steep liquor (CSL), referred to as M2CSL, serves as an efficient and cost-effective medium for ABE fermentation. This resulted in a butanol concentration of 7.4 ± 3.5 g/L. Furthermore, the research identifies variations among different types of molasses and their impact on sucrose consumption inhibition. Notably, this study highlights the potential of insect peptone derived from enzyme-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IE) as an alternative nitrogen source, while cautioning against the use of insect peptone obtained from acid-hydrolyzed black soldier fly larval meal (IA) due to its inhibitory properties.
