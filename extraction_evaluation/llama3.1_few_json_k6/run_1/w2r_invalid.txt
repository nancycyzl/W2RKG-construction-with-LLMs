The application of Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) waste as a functional material remains a challenge, but its hydrophobic properties offer potential for superhydrophobic surfaces.

A coating made from EPS waste was applied to surfaces in two ways: spray coating and dip coating. The addition of ZnO was intended to enhance surface roughness, but it resulted in only a hydrophobic surface, with maximum water contact angles of 119° and 125° respectively.

The SEM image revealed many holes on the surface that contributed to its increased roughness. This property led to reduced cleaning time for food packaging applications.

While the coating met requirements for heavy metals and ethanol stimulant migration testing according to Indonesian Food and Drug Administration (BPOM) regulations, it exceeded the maximum standard for acetic acid stimulant migration testing.

The total migration value in 3% acetic acid stimulant at 40°C for 10 days was 22.95 mg/dm2, surpassing the allowed maximum of 10 mg/dm2.
