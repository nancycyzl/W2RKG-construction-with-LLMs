This study assesses the environmental impacts of recycling aluminum in rotary furnaces with two different salt-slag management approaches: valorisation and landfilling. The results show that recycling aluminum brings considerable net environmental benefits, especially when salt-slag is valorised. Key findings include:

* Aluminum recycling generates significant net environmental profits.
* Valorising salt-slag increases these profits across all impact categories.
* Secondary cast aluminum alloys production contributes to energy savings due to the high energy intensity of primary aluminum production.
* Other hotspots that should be optimised for better environmental performance are by-product production, energy/fuel consumption, and waste landfilling avoidance.
* Salt-slag valorisation improves indicators for mineral resource scarcity, human carcinogenic toxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity.

The study explores the use of waste materials from kraft pulp mills (lime sludge and lime slaker grits) to produce magnesium oxysulfate (MOS)-based fiber cement boards, as an alternative to traditional building materials. The results show that:

* Replacing 25% of limestone with grits has no noticeable effect on the properties of the boards.
* MOR values close to 11.17 MPa were obtained.
* Using lime sludge and higher concentrations of grits lead to a decrease in physical-mechanical performance, likely due to Na2SO4.XH2O formation and ITZ structure formed around aggregated particles.
* Accelerated carbonation in a saturated atmosphere leads to the carbonation of the 5–1–7 phase, causing a decrease in mechanical strength of the boards after curing.
* The thermal decomposition of Hydrated Magnesium Carbonates (HMCs) formed during accelerated carbonation contributes to the reduction in water absorption of the boards.

* Methane energy yields ranged from 2.29 to 7.64 MJ/m3.
* Volatile solid removal was enhanced in the treated RS-LDPE mixture compared to the untreated substrate.
* The bacterial community composition changed after AD, with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Protobacteria being crucial for digesting RS and LDPE.
