The text does not contain a question that requires an answer in the format of a single number or a simple statement, but rather discusses a research topic and its findings. Therefore, I will provide a summary of the main points:

The article describes the potential for metathetic degradation as a strategy to treat waste vulcanized rubbers. It mentions that while this approach has been used for natural rubber, it had not been applied to emulsion type butadiene-based rubbers due to their low cis-1,4-unit content. The study explores the metathetic degradation of nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) gloves as a model and finds that ring closing metathesis between adjacent cis-1,4-structure and 1,2-structure occurs in addition to cross metathesis. This finding is expected to open up possibilities for treating all waste vulcanized emulsion type diene-based rubbers.

----------

There is no result to be obtained from this paragraph. It appears to be a scientific article discussing experimental research on advanced thermochemical technologies for plastic waste valorization, specifically autothermal steam-oxygen gasification in fluidized bed reactors. The text describes the experiments and their outcomes, as well as the validation of a kinetic model for predicting reactor behavior. 

However, if you're looking for potential takeaways or implications from this article, here are some possible conclusions:

* Advanced thermochemical technologies may be an effective alternative to waste-to-energy options.
* Autothermal steam-oxygen gasification in fluidized bed reactors has significant market potential.
* The equivalence ratio and steam-to-carbon molar ratio are critical parameters affecting syngas composition and reactor temperature.
* A reliable kinetic model can predict reactor behavior under conditions of pure steam-oxygen gasification.
* Steam plays a crucial role in controlling the reactor temperature, especially when the steam-to-carbon molar ratio is larger than 1.5.

Please note that these are not actual results, but rather inferred implications based on the content of the paragraph.

The application of expanded polystyrene waste to create functional materials still presents a challenge, particularly in terms of achieving superhydrophobic surfaces. Despite this, researchers have successfully used EPS waste in two different coating methods—spray coating and dip coating—to produce surfaces with high water contact angles of 119° and 125° respectively. The incorporation of ZnO was expected to enhance the surface roughness and hydrophobicity but resulted only in a hydrophobic surface instead.

The SEM images revealed the presence of numerous holes, contributing to the increased roughness of the surface. Notably, the superhydrophobic surfaces produced significant reductions in cleaning time. However, when tested for compliance with food packaging standards mandated by the Indonesian Food and Drug Administration (BPOM), the results showed that while the coating met requirements for heavy metals and ethanol stimulant migration testing, it exceeded the maximum standard for acetic acid stimulant migration. The total migration in 3% acetic acid stimulant (40°C for 10 days) was 22.95 mg/dm2, which is above the permitted maximum value of 10 mg/dm2.

Therefore, while the study demonstrated the potential of EPS waste in creating superhydrophobic surfaces, further research and development are required to ensure compliance with food packaging standards and regulations.

3. **Key extraction conditions**: The optimal extraction conditions for SCFAs were:
	* Room temperature (25–50 °C)
	* A mixture of trioctylamine (TOA) and tributylphosphate (TBP) at 10% in octan-1-ol
	* Extraction yields up to 34% of the total SCFs present in the 1 kDa permeate
