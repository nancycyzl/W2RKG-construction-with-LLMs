The research explores the possibility of treating waste vulcanized emulsion type butadiene-based rubbers through metathetic degradation, which is a promising strategy to turn waste into resources, eliminating pollution and recycling them as valuable materials. This approach was previously used for natural rubber, but not for emulsion-type rubbers like nitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), despite their higher consumption and potential for similar treatment. The study investigated the degradation of NBR gloves, a model for waste vulcanized emulsion type butadiene-based rubbers, revealing that it involves both cross metathesis between cis-1,4-structure and chain transfer agents, as well as ring closing metathesis between adjacent cis-1,4- and 1,2- structures. This finding is significant because it opens the door for the recycling of all types of waste vulcanized emulsion type diene-based rubbers through a Waste-to-Resources approach.
